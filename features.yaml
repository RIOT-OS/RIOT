# The syntax is relatively simple: A group is a mapping that may contain a
# string-valued "title" and "help", may contain a list of groups under the
# "groups" key, and a list of features under the "features" key, where a
# feature is expressed as a mapping that contains a "name" and a "help" string.
# The syntax is formally described in dist/tools/features_yaml2mx/schema.cddl.
#
# Note: The syntax or even the file format will likely change and evolve over

          is a globally unique ID, in the worst case it is some calibration

  - name: periph_dma
    help: A DMA peripheral is present. Enabling this feature affects the
          implementation of other peripheral drivers. E.g. SPI/I²C/UART/...
          transfers may use the DMA (possible only when transfers are longer than
          a certain cut-off). The main benefit is that other threads can run
          while the thread issuing the, say SPI transfer, is blocked until the
          transfer is completed. It often also speeds up longer transfers.

            exposes a number of advanced features and lower latency GPIO
            access at the cost of a more complex and more frequently

  - name: bug_newlib_broken_stdio
    help: newlib's stdio is not inherently thread-safe, but depends on the
          reentrancy hooks to be provided for correct operation. When
          reentrancy is not enabled, using newlib's stdio is racy, causing
          random crashes at runtime. Use of this feature will cause an
          alternative stdio implementation to be used if (and only if) newlib
          is used as standard c lib.
