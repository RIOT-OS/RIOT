 * @brief       Low-level flash page driver implementation
 *
 * The sam0 has its flash memory organized in pages and rows, where each row
 * consists of 4 pages. While pages are writable one at a time, it is only
 * possible to delete a complete row. This implementation abstracts this
 * behavior by only writing complete rows at a time, so the FLASHPAGE_SIZE we
 * use in RIOT is actually the row size as specified in the datasheet.
