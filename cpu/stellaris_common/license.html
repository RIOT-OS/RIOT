      <p>(ii). <em>Assurance of Compliance.</em> You understand and acknowledge that products, technology (regardless of the form in
         which it is provided), software or software source code, received from TI or any of
         its affiliates under this Agreement may be under export control of the United States
         or other countries. You shall comply with the United States and other applicable non-U.S.
         laws and regulations governing the export, re-export and release of any products,
         technology, software, or software source code received under this Agreement from TI
         or its affiliates. You shall not undertake any action that is prohibited by the EAR.
         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you specifically agree that you
         shall not transfer or release products, technology, software, or software source code
         of TI or its affiliates to, or for use by, military end users or for use in military,
         missile, nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons end uses.
      </p>
      <p>(iii). <em>Licenses.</em> Each party shall secure at its own expense, such licenses and export and import documents
         as are necessary for each respective party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
         If such licenses or government approvals cannot be obtained, TI may terminate this
         Agreement, or shall otherwise be excused from the performance of any obligations it
         may have under this Agreement for which the licenses or government approvals are required.
      </p>
      <p>13. <b>Entire Agreement.</b> This is the entire Agreement between you and TI, and absent a signed and effective
         software license agreement related to the subject matter of this Agreement, this Agreement
         supersedes any prior agreement between the parties related to the subject matter of
         this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any signed and effective software license
         agreement relating to the subject matter hereof will supersede the terms of this Agreement.
         No amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing
         and signed by a duly authorized representative of TI. You hereby warrant and represent
         that you have obtained all authorizations and other applicable consents required empowering
         you to enter into this Agreement.
