	set to hardcoded values in this function.

									optional attributes that the simple link driver receives
									on opening the device. in systems that the spi channel is
									not implemented as part of the os device drivers, this
									parameter could be NULL.
	\param			flags		-	option flags

	\return			upon successful completion, the function shall open the spi channel and return
					a non-negative integer representing the file descriptor.
