## Definition of specific features
config HAS_ARCH_ESP32
    bool
    help
        Indicates that the current architecture is any ESP32x SoC architecture.

config HAS_CPU_ESP32
    bool
    help
        Indicates that the current CPU belongs to the ESP32x SoC series.

config HAS_ESP_HW_COUNTER
    bool
    help
        Indicates that the used ESP32x SoC supports HW counters that can be
        used as timers.

config HAS_ESP_RTC_TIMER_32K
    bool
    help
        Indicates that an external 32.768 kHz crystal is connected to the
        ESP32x Soc on the board.

config HAS_ESP_SPI_RAM
    bool
    help
        Indicates that an external RAM is connected via the SPI interface to
        the ESP32x SoC on the board.

config HAS_ESP_SPI_OCT
    bool
    help
        Indicates that Octal SPI mode is used for Flash and SPI RAM. In this
        case additional GPIOs are used for the SPI interface and cannot be
        used for other purposes.
