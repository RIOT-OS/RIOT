ESP32 provides an <b>Ethernet MAC layer module (EMAC)</b> according to the IEEE 802.3 standard which can be used together with an external physical layer chip (PHY) to realize a 100/10 Mbps Ethernet interface. Supported PHY chips are the Microchip LAN8710/LAN8720 and the Texas Instruments TLK110.

The RIOT port for ESP32 realizes with module ```esp_eth``` a ```netdev``` driver for the EMAC which uses RIOT's standard Ethernet interface.

If the board has one of the supported PHY layer chips connected to the ESP32, the ```esp_eth``` module should be enabled by default in board's ```Makefile.dep``` when module ```netdev_default``` is used.
```
ifneq (,$(filter netdev_default,$(USEMODULE)))
    USEMODULE += esp_eth
endif
```
Otherwise, the application has to add the ```esp_eth``` module in its makefile when needed.

@note
The board has to have one of the supported PHY modules to be able to use the Ethernet MAC module.
