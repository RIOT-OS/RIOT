/* ESP32 Linker Script Memory Layout

   This file describes the memory layout (memory blocks) as virtual
   memory addresses.

   esp32.project.ld contains output sections to link compiler output
   into these memory blocks.

   ***

   This linker script is passed through the C preprocessor to include
   configuration options.

   Please use preprocessor features sparingly! Restrict
   to simple macros with numeric values, and/or #if/#endif blocks.
