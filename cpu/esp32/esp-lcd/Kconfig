        driver.

        The ESP32x SoC variant used does not have a peripheral for the parallel
        low-level interface. However, it can be emulated with special low-level
        GPIO operations. It is faster than the GPIO-driven 8-/16-bit parallel
        interface implemented in the LCD driver, but requires 4 kByte RAM for
        8-bit data bus width and 8 kByte RAM for 16-bit data bus width.

        Defines the clock rate that is used for the LCD write signal. It
        depends on used ESP32x SoC variant and used display interface.

    int "LCD data buffer size in byte"

    default 512
    help
        Defines the size of the buffers used to write data to the LCD
        screen. Since double buffering is used, there are two buffers
        of this size. One buffer is used first by the LCD driver to
        write the data that needs to be transferred to the LCD, and
        one buffer from which the DMA then transfers the data to the
        LCD peripherals. This allows data to be written before the
        DMA transfer is complete. The larger the buffers, the better
        the performance, but the higher the memory requirements.
