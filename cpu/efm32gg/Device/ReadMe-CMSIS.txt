================ CMSIS Peripheral Support Library ============================

This archive contains header file and peripheral support libraries for 
Silicon Labs EFM32 microcontrollers and EFR4 RF transceivers/SoCs.

================ About CMSIS =================================================

The library and header files are based on CMSIS, the Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard, as defined by ARM Ltd. 

For more information about the CMSIS standard in itself see 
    http://www.onarm.com/cmsis
    http://www.arm.com/cmsis

In short, CMSIS tries to provide a common interface for programming devices 
having one of the Cortex-M core architectures, making code sharing and reuse
easier.

================ Development Environments ====================================

You will need a development environment which supports Silicon Labs EFM32/EFR4
devices. Currently this can be one of either

Atollic TrueStudio for ARM

CooCox CoIDE
  http://www.coocox.com

Hitex HiTop IDE

IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM
  http://www.iar.com

Keil uVision "MDK-ARM"
  http://www.keil.com

Mentor Graphics CodeBench (previously Codesourcery Sourcery G++)

The version required depends on the family of products you are developing 
for, check with the vendor for compliance for a particular device.

It is possible to develop with other tools, but these vendors provide good,
integrated development environments for Silicon Labs EFM32/EFR4 devices.

This library uses C99-types, requires the presence of <stdint.h> and can use
other functionality standardized in C99. If your compiler has a C99 compliance
toggle, you should enable it for your projects.

================ File structure ==============================================

Short getting started guide:

The quickest way to start is to base your work on one of the simple example
projects for the Silicon Labs EFM32/EFR4 Development or Starter Kits. These 
should be easy to port and change to adopt to your needs.

The board support packages for the various Silicon Labs EFM32/EFR4 kits comes 
with a "blink" example, that serves as a good starting point for new projects.

Please note that you _will_ need to change the "Debugger" and "Flash/Download"
configuration settings to fit your environment. See your IDE's manual for 
details. You might also need to change the limits of the linker file to adopt
to your part's SRAM and flash size limits.

Support for Silicon Labs EFM32/EFR4 devices family is located in the directory
  Device/SiliconLabs/<FAMILY>, 
where family could be one of EFM32G, EFM32TG, EFM32GG, EFM32LG, EFR4D or
others.

The most convenient way to start a project, is to define the device target
in your compiler options, e.g. add a -DEFM32G890F128 to your compile options
if you are targetting an EFM32G890F128 part.

Include the file "em_device.h" wherever you need register and bit field 
definitions for the peripherals or the MCUs/RF transceivers, after setting
the correct include path to point to your "family".

Gecko/Draco peripheral registers follow the CMSIS convention of defining a 
structure which hold "volatile" peripheral registers. Again, take a look 
at the examples for usage.

================ Licenses ====================================================
