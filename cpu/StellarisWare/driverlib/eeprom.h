//*****************************************************************************

//
//! This value may be returned from a call to EEPROMInit().  It indicates that
//! no previous write operations were interrupted by a reset event and that the
//! EEPROM peripheral is ready for use.
//
#define EEPROM_INIT_OK      0

//
//! This value may be returned from a call to EEPROMInit().  It indicates that
//! a previous data or protection write operation was interrupted by a reset
//! event.  The EEPROM peripheral has recovered its state but the last write
//! operation may have been lost.  The application must check the validity of
//! data it has written and retry any writes as required.
//
#define EEPROM_INIT_RETRY   1

//
//! This value may be returned from a call to EEPROMInit(). It indicates that a
//! previous data or protection write operation was interrupted by a reset
//! event and that the EEPROM peripheral was unable to clean up after the
//! problem.  This situation may be resolved with another reset or may be fatal
//! depending upon the cause of the problem.  For example, if the voltage to
//! the part is unstable, retrying once the voltage has stabilized may clear
//! the error.
//
#define EEPROM_INIT_ERROR   2

//*****************************************************************************
//
// Error indicators returned by various EEPROM API calls.  These will be ORed
// together into the final return code.
//
//*****************************************************************************

//
//! This return code bit indicates that the EEPROM programming state machine
//! failed to write a value due to the voltage level dropping below that
//! required for EEPROM programming.  The operation may be retried once the
//! voltage stabilizes.
//
#define EEPROM_RC_INVPL             0x00000100

//
//! This return code bit indicates that an attempt was made to read from
//! the EEPROM while a write operation was in progress.
//
#define EEPROM_RC_WRBUSY            0x00000020

//
//! This return code bit indicates that an attempt was made to write a
//! value but the destination permissions disallow write operations.  This
//! may be due to the destination block being locked, access protection set
//! to prohibit writes or an attempt to write a password when one is already
//! written.
//
#define EEPROM_RC_NOPERM            0x00000010

//
//! This return code bit indicates that the EEPROM programming state machine
//! is currently copying to or from the internal copy buffer to make room for
//! a newly written value.  It is provided as a status indicator and does not
//! indicate an error.
//
#define EEPROM_RC_WKCOPY            0x00000008

//
//! This return code bit indicates that the EEPROM programming state machine
//! is currently erasing the internal copy buffer.  It is provided as a
//! status indicator and does not indicate an error.
//
#define EEPROM_RC_WKERASE           0x00000004

//
//! This return code bit indicates that the EEPROM programming state machine
//! is currently working.  No new write operations should be attempted until
//! this bit is clear.

//
// Values that can be passed to EEPROMBlockProtectSet() in the ulProtect
// parameter, and returned by EEPROMBlockProtectGet().
//
//*****************************************************************************

//
//! This bit may be ORed with the protection option passed to
//! EEPROMBlockProtectSet() or returned from EEPROMBlockProtectGet().  It
//! restricts EEPROM access to threads running in supervisor mode and prevents
//! access to an EEPROM block when the CPU is in user mode.
//
#define EEPROM_PROT_SUPERVISOR_ONLY 0x00000008

//
//! This value may be passed to EEPROMBlockProtectSet() or returned from
//! EEPROMBlockProtectGet().  It indicates that the block should offer
//! read/write access when no password is set or when a password is set and
//! the block is unlocked, and read-only access when a password is set but
//! the block is locked.
//
#define EEPROM_PROT_RW_LRO_URW      0x00000000

//
//! This value may be passed to EEPROMBlockProtectSet() or returned from
//! EEPROMBlockProtectGet().  It indicates that the block should offer neither
//! read nor write access unless it is protected by a password and unlocked.
//
#define EEPROM_PROT_NA_LNA_URW      0x00000001

//
//! This value may be passed to EEPROMBlockProtectSet() or returned from
//! EEPROMBlockProtectGet().  It indicates that the block should offer
//! read-only access when no password is set or when a password is set and the
//! block is unlocked.  When a password is set and the block is locked, neither
//! read nor write access is permitted.
