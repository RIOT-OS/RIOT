 * @brief Converts the elements of the floating-point vector to Q31 vector.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrc points to the floating-point input vector    
 * @param[out]      *pDst points to the Q31 output vector   
 * @param[in]       blockSize length of the input vector    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 *\par Description:    
 * \par   
 * The equation used for the conversion process is:    
 *   
 * <pre>    
 * 	pDst[n] = (q31_t)(pSrc[n] * 2147483648);   0 <= n < blockSize.    
 * </pre>    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function uses saturating arithmetic.    
 * Results outside of the allowable Q31 range[0x80000000 0x7FFFFFFF] will be saturated.    
 *   
 * \note In order to apply rounding, the library should be rebuilt with the ROUNDING macro     
 * defined in the preprocessor section of project options.
