 * @brief Dot product of Q31 vectors.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcA points to the first input vector    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcB points to the second input vector    
 * @param[in]       blockSize number of samples in each vector    
 * @param[out]      *result output result returned here    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The intermediate multiplications are in 1.31 x 1.31 = 2.62 format and these    
 * are truncated to 2.48 format by discarding the lower 14 bits.    
 * The 2.48 result is then added without saturation to a 64-bit accumulator in 16.48 format.    
 * There are 15 guard bits in the accumulator and there is no risk of overflow as long as    
 * the length of the vectors is less than 2^16 elements.    
 * The return result is in 16.48 format.
