 * @brief Dot product of Q15 vectors.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcA points to the first input vector    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcB points to the second input vector    
 * @param[in]       blockSize number of samples in each vector    
 * @param[out]      *result output result returned here    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The intermediate multiplications are in 1.15 x 1.15 = 2.30 format and these    
 * results are added to a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.    
 * Nonsaturating additions are used and given that there are 33 guard bits in the accumulator    
 * there is no risk of overflow.    
 * The return result is in 34.30 format.
