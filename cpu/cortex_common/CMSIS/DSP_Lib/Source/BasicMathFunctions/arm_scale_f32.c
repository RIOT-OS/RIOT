 * Multiply a vector by a scalar value.  For floating-point data, the algorithm used is:        
 *        
 * <pre>        
 *     pDst[n] = pSrc[n] * scale,   0 <= n < blockSize.        
 * </pre>        
 *        
 * In the fixed-point Q7, Q15, and Q31 functions, <code>scale</code> is represented by        
 * a fractional multiplication <code>scaleFract</code> and an arithmetic shift <code>shift</code>.        
 * The shift allows the gain of the scaling operation to exceed 1.0.        
 * The algorithm used with fixed-point data is:        
 *        
 * <pre>        
 *     pDst[n] = (pSrc[n] * scaleFract) << shift,   0 <= n < blockSize.        
 * </pre>        
 *        
 * The overall scale factor applied to the fixed-point data is        
 * <pre>        
 *     scale = scaleFract * 2^shift.        
 * </pre>        
 *
 * The functions support in-place computation allowing the source and destination
 * pointers to reference the same memory buffer.
