* @brief Processing function for Q31 normalized LMS filter.    
* @param[in] *S points to an instance of the Q31 normalized LMS filter structure.    
* @param[in] *pSrc points to the block of input data.    
* @param[in] *pRef points to the block of reference data.    
* @param[out] *pOut points to the block of output data.    
* @param[out] *pErr points to the block of error data.    
* @param[in] blockSize number of samples to process.    
* @return none.    
*    
* <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>     
* \par     
* The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.     
* The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate   
* multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.     
* Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clip.     
* In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by    
* log2(numTaps) bits. The reference signal should not be scaled down.     
* After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is shifted    
* and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.     
* The output signal and error signal are in 1.31 format.     
*    
* \par    
* 	In this filter, filter coefficients are updated for each sample and the    
* updation of filter cofficients are saturted.    
*
