   * @brief Initialization function for floating-point normalized LMS filter.    
   * @param[in] *S points to an instance of the floating-point LMS filter structure.    
   * @param[in] numTaps  number of filter coefficients.    
   * @param[in] *pCoeffs points to coefficient buffer.    
   * @param[in] *pState points to state buffer.    
   * @param[in] mu step size that controls filter coefficient updates.    
   * @param[in] blockSize number of samples to process.    
   * @return none.    
   *    
 * \par Description:    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to the array of filter coefficients stored in time reversed order:    
 * <pre>    
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}    
 * </pre>    
 * The initial filter coefficients serve as a starting point for the adaptive filter.    
 * <code>pState</code> points to an array of length <code>numTaps+blockSize-1</code> samples,    
 * where <code>blockSize</code> is the number of input samples processed by each call to <code>arm_lms_norm_f32()</code>.
