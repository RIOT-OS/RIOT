 * @brief Correlation of Q7 sequences.    
 * @param[in] *pSrcA points to the first input sequence.    
 * @param[in] srcALen length of the first input sequence.    
 * @param[in] *pSrcB points to the second input sequence.    
 * @param[in] srcBLen length of the second input sequence.    
 * @param[out] *pDst points to the location where the output result is written.  Length 2 * max(srcALen, srcBLen) - 1.    
 * @param[in]  *pScratch1 points to scratch buffer(of type q15_t) of size max(srcALen, srcBLen) + 2*min(srcALen, srcBLen) - 2.    
 * @param[in]  *pScratch2 points to scratch buffer (of type q15_t) of size min(srcALen, srcBLen).    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 *    
 * \par Restrictions    
 *  If the silicon does not support unaligned memory access enable the macro UNALIGNED_SUPPORT_DISABLE    
 *	In this case input, output, scratch1 and scratch2 buffers should be aligned by 32-bit     
 *        
 * @details    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using a 32-bit internal accumulator.    
 * Both the inputs are represented in 1.7 format and multiplications yield a 2.14 result.    
 * The 2.14 intermediate results are accumulated in a 32-bit accumulator in 18.14 format.    
 * This approach provides 17 guard bits and there is no risk of overflow as long as <code>max(srcALen, srcBLen)<131072</code>.    
 * The 18.14 result is then truncated to 18.7 format by discarding the low 7 bits and saturated to 1.7 format.
