/**  
* @defgroup FIR Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters  
*  
* This set of functions implements Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters  
* for Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.  Fast versions of Q15 and Q31 are also provided.  
* The functions operate on blocks of input and output data and each call to the function processes  
* <code>blockSize</code> samples through the filter.  <code>pSrc</code> and  
* <code>pDst</code> points to input and output arrays containing <code>blockSize</code> values.  
*  
* \par Algorithm:  
* The FIR filter algorithm is based upon a sequence of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations.  
* Each filter coefficient <code>b[n]</code> is multiplied by a state variable which equals a previous input sample <code>x[n]</code>.  
* <pre>  
*    y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[1] * x[n-1] + b[2] * x[n-2] + ...+ b[numTaps-1] * x[n-numTaps+1]  
* </pre>  
* \par  
* \image html FIR.gif "Finite Impulse Response filter"  
* \par  
* <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>.  
* Coefficients are stored in time reversed order.  
* \par  
* <pre>  
*    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}  
* </pre>  
* \par  
* <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>numTaps + blockSize - 1</code>.  
* Samples in the state buffer are stored in the following order.  
* \par  
* <pre>  
*    {x[n-numTaps+1], x[n-numTaps], x[n-numTaps-1], x[n-numTaps-2]....x[0], x[1], ..., x[blockSize-1]}  
* </pre>  
* \par  
* Note that the length of the state buffer exceeds the length of the coefficient array by <code>blockSize-1</code>.  
* The increased state buffer length allows circular addressing, which is traditionally used in the FIR filters,  
* to be avoided and yields a significant speed improvement.  
* The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed; the coefficients are untouched.  
* \par Instance Structure  
* The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.  
* A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.  
* Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable arrays cannot be shared.  
* There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 4 supported data types.  
*  
* \par Initialization Functions  
* There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.  
* The initialization function performs the following operations:  
* - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.  
* - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.  
* To do this manually without calling the init function, assign the follow subfields of the instance structure:
* numTaps, pCoeffs, pState. Also set all of the values in pState to zero. 
*  
* \par  
* Use of the initialization function is optional.  
* However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.  
* To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.  
* Set the values in the state buffer to zeros before static initialization.  
* The code below statically initializes each of the 4 different data type filter instance structures  
* <pre>  
*arm_fir_instance_f32 S = {numTaps, pState, pCoeffs};  
*arm_fir_instance_q31 S = {numTaps, pState, pCoeffs};  
*arm_fir_instance_q15 S = {numTaps, pState, pCoeffs};  
*arm_fir_instance_q7 S =  {numTaps, pState, pCoeffs};  
* </pre>  
*  
* where <code>numTaps</code> is the number of filter coefficients in the filter; <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer;  
* <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer.  
*  
* \par Fixed-Point Behavior  
* Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR filter functions.  
* In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.  
* Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.
