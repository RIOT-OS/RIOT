 /**    
 * @brief Processing function for Q31 LMS filter.    
 * @param[in]  *S points to an instance of the Q15 LMS filter structure.    
 * @param[in]  *pSrc points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[in]  *pRef points to the block of reference data.    
 * @param[out] *pOut points to the block of output data.    
 * @param[out] *pErr points to the block of error data.    
 * @param[in]  blockSize number of samples to process.    
 * @return     none.    
 *    
 * \par Scaling and Overflow Behavior:     
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.     
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate    
 * multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.     
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clips.     
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by    
 * log2(numTaps) bits.     
 * The reference signal should not be scaled down.     
 * After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is shifted    
 * and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.     
 * The output signal and error signal are in 1.31 format.     
 *    
 * \par    
 * 	In this filter, filter coefficients are updated for each sample and the updation of filter cofficients are saturted.
