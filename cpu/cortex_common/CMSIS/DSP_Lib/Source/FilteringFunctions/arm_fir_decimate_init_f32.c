 * @brief  Initialization function for the floating-point FIR decimator.    
 * @param[in,out] *S points to an instance of the floating-point FIR decimator structure.    
 * @param[in] numTaps  number of coefficients in the filter.    
 * @param[in] M  decimation factor.    
 * @param[in] *pCoeffs points to the filter coefficients.    
 * @param[in] *pState points to the state buffer.    
 * @param[in] blockSize number of input samples to process per call.    
 * @return    The function returns ARM_MATH_SUCCESS if initialization was successful or ARM_MATH_LENGTH_ERROR if    
 * <code>blockSize</code> is not a multiple of <code>M</code>.    
 *    
 * <b>Description:</b>    
 * \par    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to the array of filter coefficients stored in time reversed order:    
 * <pre>    
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}    
 * </pre>    
 * \par    
 * <code>pState</code> points to the array of state variables.    
 * <code>pState</code> is of length <code>numTaps+blockSize-1</code> words where <code>blockSize</code> is the number of input samples passed to <code>arm_fir_decimate_f32()</code>.    
 * <code>M</code> is the decimation factor.
