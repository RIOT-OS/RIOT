 * @brief  Initialization function for the floating-point transposed direct form II Biquad cascade filter.   
 * @param[in,out] *S           points to an instance of the filter data structure.   
 * @param[in]     numStages    number of 2nd order stages in the filter.   
 * @param[in]     *pCoeffs     points to the filter coefficients.   
 * @param[in]     *pState      points to the state buffer.   
 * @return        none   
 *    
 * <b>Coefficient and State Ordering:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The coefficients are stored in the array <code>pCoeffs</code> in the following order:    
 * <pre>    
 *     {b10, b11, b12, a11, a12, b20, b21, b22, a21, a22, ...}    
 * </pre>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * where <code>b1x</code> and <code>a1x</code> are the coefficients for the first stage,    
 * <code>b2x</code> and <code>a2x</code> are the coefficients for the second stage,    
 * and so on.  The <code>pCoeffs</code> array contains a total of <code>5*numStages</code> values.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * The <code>pState</code> is a pointer to state array.    
 * Each Biquad stage has 2 state variables <code>d1,</code> and <code>d2</code>.    
 * The 2 state variables for stage 1 are first, then the 2 state variables for stage 2, and so on.    
 * The state array has a total length of <code>2*numStages</code> values.    
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed; the coefficients are untouched.
