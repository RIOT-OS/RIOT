 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * This function is optimized for speed at the expense of fixed-point precision and overflow protection.    
 * The result of each 1.31 x 1.31 multiplication is truncated to 2.30 format.    
 * These intermediate results are added to a 2.30 accumulator.    
 * Finally, the accumulator is saturated and converted to a 1.31 result.    
 * The fast version has the same overflow behavior as the standard version and provides less precision since it discards the low 32 bits of each multiplication result.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by log2(numTaps) bits.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Refer to the function <code>arm_fir_q31()</code> for a slower implementation of this function which uses a 64-bit accumulator to provide higher precision.  Both the slow and the fast versions use the same instance structure.    
 * Use the function <code>arm_fir_init_q31()</code> to initialize the filter structure.
