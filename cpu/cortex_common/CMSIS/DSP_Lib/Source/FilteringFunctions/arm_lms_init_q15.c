* @brief Initialization function for the Q15 LMS filter.    
* @param[in] *S points to an instance of the Q15 LMS filter structure.    
* @param[in] numTaps  number of filter coefficients.    
* @param[in] *pCoeffs points to the coefficient buffer.    
* @param[in] *pState points to the state buffer.    
* @param[in] mu step size that controls filter coefficient updates.    
* @param[in] blockSize number of samples to process.    
* @param[in] postShift bit shift applied to coefficients.    
* @return    none.    
*    
* \par Description:    
* <code>pCoeffs</code> points to the array of filter coefficients stored in time reversed order:    
* <pre>    
*    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}    
* </pre>    
* The initial filter coefficients serve as a starting point for the adaptive filter.    
* <code>pState</code> points to the array of state variables and size of array is    
* <code>numTaps+blockSize-1</code> samples, where <code>blockSize</code> is the number of    
* input samples processed by each call to <code>arm_lms_q15()</code>.
