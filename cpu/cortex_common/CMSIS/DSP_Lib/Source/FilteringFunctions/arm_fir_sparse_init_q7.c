 * @brief  Initialization function for the Q7 sparse FIR filter.   
 * @param[in,out] *S         points to an instance of the Q7 sparse FIR structure.   
 * @param[in]     numTaps    number of nonzero coefficients in the filter.   
 * @param[in]     *pCoeffs   points to the array of filter coefficients.   
 * @param[in]     *pState    points to the state buffer.   
 * @param[in]     *pTapDelay points to the array of offset times.   
 * @param[in]     maxDelay   maximum offset time supported.   
 * @param[in]     blockSize  number of samples that will be processed per block.   
 * @return none   
 *    
 * <b>Description:</b>    
 * \par    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> holds the filter coefficients and has length <code>numTaps</code>.    
 * <code>pState</code> holds the filter's state variables and must be of length    
 * <code>maxDelay + blockSize</code>, where <code>maxDelay</code>    
 * is the maximum number of delay line values.    
 * <code>blockSize</code> is the    
 * number of samples processed by the <code>arm_fir_sparse_q7()</code> function.
