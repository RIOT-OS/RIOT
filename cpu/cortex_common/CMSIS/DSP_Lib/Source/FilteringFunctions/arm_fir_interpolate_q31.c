/**    
 * @brief Processing function for the Q31 FIR interpolator.    
 * @param[in] *S        points to an instance of the Q31 FIR interpolator structure.    
 * @param[in] *pSrc     points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[out] *pDst    points to the block of output data.    
 * @param[in] blockSize number of input samples to process per call.    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.    
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clip.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by <code>1/(numTaps/L)</code>.    
 * since <code>numTaps/L</code> additions occur per output sample.    
 * After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is truncated to 1.32 format and then saturated to 1.31 format.
