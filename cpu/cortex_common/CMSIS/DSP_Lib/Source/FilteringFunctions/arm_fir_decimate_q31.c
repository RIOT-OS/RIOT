/**    
 * @brief Processing function for the Q31 FIR decimator.    
 * @param[in] *S points to an instance of the Q31 FIR decimator structure.    
 * @param[in] *pSrc points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[out] *pDst points to the block of output data    
 * @param[in] blockSize number of input samples to process per call.    
 * @return none    
 *    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.    
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clip.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by log2(numTaps) bits (where log2 is read as log to the base 2).    
 * After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is truncated to 1.32 format and then saturated to 1.31 format.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * Refer to the function <code>arm_fir_decimate_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this function for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.
