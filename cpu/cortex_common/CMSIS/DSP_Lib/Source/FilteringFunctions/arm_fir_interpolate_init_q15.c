 * @brief  Initialization function for the Q15 FIR interpolator.    
 * @param[in,out] *S        points to an instance of the Q15 FIR interpolator structure.    
 * @param[in]     L         upsample factor.    
 * @param[in]     numTaps   number of filter coefficients in the filter.    
 * @param[in]     *pCoeffs  points to the filter coefficient buffer.    
 * @param[in]     *pState   points to the state buffer.    
 * @param[in]     blockSize number of input samples to process per call.    
 * @return        The function returns ARM_MATH_SUCCESS if initialization was successful or ARM_MATH_LENGTH_ERROR if    
 * the filter length <code>numTaps</code> is not a multiple of the interpolation factor <code>L</code>.    
 *    
 * <b>Description:</b>    
 * \par    
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to the array of filter coefficients stored in time reversed order:    
 * <pre>    
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[numTaps-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}    
 * </pre>    
 * The length of the filter <code>numTaps</code> must be a multiple of the interpolation factor <code>L</code>.    
 * \par    
 * <code>pState</code> points to the array of state variables.    
 * <code>pState</code> is of length <code>(numTaps/L)+blockSize-1</code> words    
 * where <code>blockSize</code> is the number of input samples processed by each call to <code>arm_fir_interpolate_q15()</code>.
