 /**    
 * @brief Processing function for Q15 LMS filter.    
 * @param[in] *S points to an instance of the Q15 LMS filter structure.    
 * @param[in] *pSrc points to the block of input data.    
 * @param[in] *pRef points to the block of reference data.    
 * @param[out] *pOut points to the block of output data.    
 * @param[out] *pErr points to the block of error data.    
 * @param[in] blockSize number of samples to process.    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * \par Scaling and Overflow Behavior:    
 * The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.    
 * Both coefficients and state variables are represented in 1.15 format and multiplications yield a 2.30 result.    
 * The 2.30 intermediate results are accumulated in a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.    
 * There is no risk of internal overflow with this approach and the full precision of intermediate multiplications is preserved.    
 * After all additions have been performed, the accumulator is truncated to 34.15 format by discarding low 15 bits.    
 * Lastly, the accumulator is saturated to yield a result in 1.15 format.    
 *   
 * \par   
 * 	In this filter, filter coefficients are updated for each sample and the updation of filter cofficients are saturted.   
 *
