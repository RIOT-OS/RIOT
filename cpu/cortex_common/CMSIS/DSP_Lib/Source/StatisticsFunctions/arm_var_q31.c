 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>        
 *        
 *\par        
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.        
 * The input is represented in 1.31 format, and intermediate multiplication        
 * yields a 2.62 format.        
 * The accumulator maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results,         
 * but provides only a single guard bit.        
 * There is no saturation on intermediate additions.        
 * If the accumulator overflows it wraps around and distorts the result.        
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by         
 * log2(blockSize) bits, as a total of blockSize additions are performed internally.         
 * Finally, the 2.62 accumulator is right shifted by 31 bits to yield a 1.31 format value.        
 *
