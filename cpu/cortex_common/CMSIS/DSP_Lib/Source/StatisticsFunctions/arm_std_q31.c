 * @brief Standard deviation of the elements of a Q31 vector.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrc points to the input vector    
 * @param[in]       blockSize length of the input vector

 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 *    
 *\par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The input is represented in 1.31 format, and intermediate multiplication    
 * yields a 2.62 format.    
 * The accumulator maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results,     
 * but provides only a single guard bit.    
 * There is no saturation on intermediate additions.    
 * If the accumulator overflows it wraps around and distorts the result.    
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by     
 * log2(blockSize) bits, as a total of blockSize additions are performed internally.     
 * Finally, the 2.62 accumulator is right shifted by 31 bits to yield a 1.31 format value.    
 *
