 * @brief Sum of the squares of the elements of a Q15 vector.    
 * @param[in]       *pSrc points to the input vector    
 * @param[in]       blockSize length of the input vector    
 * @param[out]      *pResult sum of the squares value returned here    
 * @return none.    
 *    
 * @details    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.     
 * The input is represented in 1.15 format.   
 * Intermediate multiplication yields a 2.30 format, and this    
 * result is added without saturation to a 64-bit accumulator in 34.30 format.    
 * With 33 guard bits in the accumulator, there is no risk of overflow, and the    
 * full precision of the intermediate multiplication is preserved.    
 * Finally, the return result is in 34.30 format.     
 *
