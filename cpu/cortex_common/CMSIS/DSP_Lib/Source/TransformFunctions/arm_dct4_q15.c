 * Internally inputs are downscaled in the RFFT process function to avoid overflows.    
 * Number of bits downscaled, depends on the size of the transform.

  /* DCT4 computation involves DCT2 (which is calculated using RFFT)    
   * along with some pre-processing and post-processing.    
   * Computational procedure is explained as follows:    
   * (a) Pre-processing involves multiplying input with cos factor,    
   *     r(n) = 2 * u(n) * cos(pi*(2*n+1)/(4*n))    
   *              where,    
   *                 r(n) -- output of preprocessing    
   *                 u(n) -- input to preprocessing(actual Source buffer)    
   * (b) Calculation of DCT2 using FFT is divided into three steps:    
   *                  Step1: Re-ordering of even and odd elements of input.    
   *                  Step2: Calculating FFT of the re-ordered input.    
   *                  Step3: Taking the real part of the product of FFT output and weights.    
   * (c) Post-processing - DCT4 can be obtained from DCT2 output using the following equation:    
   *                   Y4(k) = Y2(k) - Y4(k-1) and Y4(-1) = Y4(0)    
   *                        where,    
   *                           Y4 -- DCT4 output,   Y2 -- DCT2 output    
   * (d) Multiplying the output with the normalizing factor sqrt(2/N).
