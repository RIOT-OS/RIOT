 *        
 * Computes the magnitude squared of the elements of a complex data vector.        
 *       
 * The <code>pSrc</code> points to the source data and        
 * <code>pDst</code> points to the where the result should be written.        
 * <code>numSamples</code> specifies the number of complex samples        
 * in the input array and the data is stored in an interleaved fashion        
 * (real, imag, real, imag, ...).        
 * The input array has a total of <code>2*numSamples</code> values;        
 * the output array has a total of <code>numSamples</code> values.        
 *        
 * The underlying algorithm is used:        
 *        
 * <pre>        
 * for(n=0; n<numSamples; n++) {        
 *     pDst[n] = pSrc[(2*n)+0]^2 + pSrc[(2*n)+1]^2;        
 * }        
 * </pre>        
 *        
 * There are separate functions for floating-point, Q15, and Q31 data types.
