 * @brief       USB interface functions for the stm32 OTG FS/HS class devices
 *
 * The stm32f2, stm32f4 and stm32f7 have a common USB OTG FS capable USB
 * peripheral.
 *
 * Two versions are currently known to exist with subtle differences
 * in some registers. The CID register of the peripheral indicates this version,
 * 0x00001200 for one version of the full speed peripheral and 0x00002000 for
 * the other version of the full speed peripheral.
 * The main difference is in the GCCFG register, where the 1.2 version has a
 * NOVBUSSENS bit and the 2.0 version has a VBDEN bit. This difference is used
 * to detect the IP version.
 * The 2.0 version also has more advanced USB low power mode support.
 *
 * For the end user, the main difference is the 1.2 version  having 4 endpoints
 * and the 2.0 version having 6 endpoints. The 2.0 version also supports a
 * number of USB low power modes.
