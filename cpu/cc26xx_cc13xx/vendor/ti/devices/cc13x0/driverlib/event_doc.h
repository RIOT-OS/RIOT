//! \section sec_event Introduction
//!
//! The event fabric consists of two event modules. One in the MCU power domain (MCU event fabric) and
//! the other in the AON power domain (AON event fabric). The MCU event fabric is one of the subscribers
//! to the AON event fabric. For more information on AON event fabric, see [AON event API](@ref aonevent_api).
//!
//! The MCU event fabric is a combinational router between event sources and event subscribers. Most
//! event subscribers have statically routed event sources but several event subscribers have
//! configurable event sources which is configured in the MCU event fabric through this API. Although
//! configurable only a subset of event sources are available to each of the configurable event subscribers.
//! This is explained in more details in the function @ref EventRegister() which does all the event routing
//! configuration.
//!
//! MCU event fabric also contains four software events which allow software to trigger certain event
//! subscribers. Each of the four software events is an independent event source which must be set and
//! cleared in the MCU event fabric through the functions:
//! - @ref EventSwEventSet()
//! - @ref EventSwEventClear()
//! - @ref EventSwEventGet()
//!
