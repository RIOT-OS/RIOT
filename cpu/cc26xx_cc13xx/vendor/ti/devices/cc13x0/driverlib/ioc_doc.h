//! \section sec_ioc Introduction
//!
//! The Input/Output Controller (IOC) controls the functionality of the pins (called DIO).
//! The IOC consists of two APIs:
//! - MCU IOC API selects which peripheral module is connected to the individual DIO and thus allowed to control it.
//!   It also controls individual drive strength, slew rate, pull-up/pull-down, edge detection, etc.
//! - AON IOC API controls the general drive strength definitions, IO latches, and if the LF clock is
//!   routed to a DIO for external use.
//!
//! For more information on the AON IOC see the [AON IOC API](\ref aonioc_api).
//!
//! \note The output driver of a DIO is not configured by the IOC API (except for drive strength); instead, it is controlled by the
//! peripheral module which is selected to control the DIO.
//!
//! A DIO is considered "software controlled" if it is configured for GPIO control which allows the
//! System CPU to set the value of the DIO via the [GPIO API](\ref gpio_api). Alternatively, a DIO
//! can be "hardware controlled" if it is controlled by other modules than GPIO.
//!
//! \section sec_ioc_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Configure all settings at the same time:
//! - \ref IOCPortConfigureSet()
//! - \ref IOCPortConfigureGet()
//!
//! Configure individual settings:
//! - \ref IOCIODrvStrengthSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOHystSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOInputSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOIntSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOModeSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOPortIdSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOPortPullSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOShutdownSet()
//! - \ref IOCIOSlewCtrlSet()
//!
//! Handle edge detection events:
//! - \ref IOCIntEnable()
//! - \ref IOCIntDisable()
//! - \ref IOCIntClear()
//! - \ref IOCIntStatus()
//! - \ref IOCIntRegister()
//! - \ref IOCIntUnregister()
//!
//! Configure IOCs for typical use cases (can also be used as example code):
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeAux()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeGpioInput()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeGpioOutput()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeI2c()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeSsiMaster()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeSsiSlave()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeUart()
//!
