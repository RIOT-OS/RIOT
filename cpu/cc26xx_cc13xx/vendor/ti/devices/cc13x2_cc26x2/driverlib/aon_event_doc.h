//! \section sec_aonevent Introduction
//!
//! The event fabric consists of two event modules. One in the MCU power domain (MCU event fabric) and
//! the other in the AON power domain (AON event fabric). The MCU event fabric is one of the subscribers
//! to the AON event fabric. For more information on MCU event fabric, see [MCU event API](@ref event_api).
//!
//! The AON event fabric is a configurable combinatorial router between AON event sources and event
//! subscribers in both AON and MCU domains. The API to control the AON event fabric configuration
//! can be grouped based on the event subscriber to configure:
//!
//! - Wake-up events.
//!   - MCU wake-up event
//!     - @ref AONEventMcuWakeUpSet()
//!     - @ref AONEventMcuWakeUpGet()
//! - AON RTC receives a single programmable event line from the AON event fabric. For more information, see [AON RTC API](@ref aonrtc_api).
//!   - @ref AONEventRtcSet()
//!   - @ref AONEventRtcGet()
//! - MCU event fabric receives a number of programmable event lines from the AON event fabric. For more information, see [MCU event API](@ref event_api).
//!   - @ref AONEventMcuSet()
//!   - @ref AONEventMcuGet()
