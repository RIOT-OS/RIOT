//! \section sec_systick Introduction
//!
//! The system CPU includes a system timer, SysTick, integrated in the NVIC which provides a simple, 24-bit,
//! clear-on-write, decrementing, wrap-on-zero counter with a flexible control mechanism.
//! When enabled, the timer counts down on each clock from the reload value to 0, reloads (wraps) on
//! the next clock edge, then decrements on subsequent clocks.
//!
//! The SysTick counter runs on the system clock. If this clock signal is stopped for low-power mode, the
//! SysTick counter stops.
//!
//! When the processor is halted for debugging, the counter does not decrement.
//!
//! \section sec_systick_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Configuration and status:
//! - \ref SysTickPeriodSet()
//! - \ref SysTickPeriodGet()
//! - \ref SysTickValueGet()
//!
//! Enable and disable:
//! - \ref SysTickEnable()
//! - \ref SysTickDisable()
//!
//! Interrupt configuration:
//! - \ref SysTickIntRegister()
//! - \ref SysTickIntUnregister()
//! - \ref SysTickIntEnable()
//! - \ref SysTickIntDisable()
//! @}
