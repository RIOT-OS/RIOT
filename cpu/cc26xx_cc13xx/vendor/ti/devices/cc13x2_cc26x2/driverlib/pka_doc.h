//! \section sec_pka Introduction
//!
//! The PKA (Public Key Accelerator) API provides access to the Large Number
//! Engine (LNME). The LNME allows for efficient math operations on numbers
//! larger than those that fit within the ALU of the system CPU. It is significantly faster
//! to perform these operations using the LNME than implementing the same
//! functionality in software using regular word-wise math operations. While the
//! LNME runs in the background, the system CPU may perform other operations
//! or be turned off.
//!
//! The LNME supports both primitive math operations and serialized primitive
//! operations (sequencer operations).
//!     - Addition
//!     - Multiplication
//!     - Comparison
//!     - Modulo
//!     - Inverse Modulo
//!     - ECC Point Addition (including point doubling)
//!     - ECC Scalar Multiplication
//!
//! These primitives and sequencer operations can be used to implement various
//! public key encryption schemes.
//! It is possible to implement the following schemes using the operations mentioned above:
//!     - RSA encryption and decryption
//!     - RSA sign and verify
//!     - DHE (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
//!     - ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
//!     - ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
//!     - ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)
//!
//! The DriverLib PKA functions copy the relevant parameters into the dedicated
//! PKA RAM. The LNME requires these parameters be present and correctly
//! formatted in the PKA RAM and not system RAM. They are copied word-wise as
//! the PKA RAM does not support byte-wise access. The CPU handles the alignment differences
//! during the memory copy operation. Forcing buffer alignment in system RAM results
//! in a significant speedup of the copy operation compared to unaligned buffers.
//!
//! When the operation completes, the result is copied back into
//! a buffer in system RAM specified by the application. The PKA RAM is then cleared
//! to prevent sensitive keying material from remaining in PKA RAM.
