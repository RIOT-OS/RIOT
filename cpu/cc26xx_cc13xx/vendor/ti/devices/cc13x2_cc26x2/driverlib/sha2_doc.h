//! \section sec_sha2 Introduction
//!
//! The SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm) API provides access to the SHA-2
//!	functionality of the crypto core. The AES accelerator and keystore are
//! also contained  within the crypto core. Hence, only one of SHA-2 and AES
//! may be used at the same time.
//! This module offers hardware acceleration for the SHA-2 family of hash
//! algorithms. The following output digest sizes are supported:
//! - 224 bits
//! - 256 bits
//! - 384 bits
//! - 512 bits
//!
//! Messages are hashed in one go or in multiple steps. Stepwise hashing
//! consists of an initial hash, multiple intermediate hashes, and a
//! finalization hash.
//!
//! The crypto core does not have retention and all configuration settings
//! are lost when going into standby or shutdown. If you wish to continue
//!	a hash operation after going into standby or shutdown, you must load
//! the intermediate hash into system RAM before entering standby or shutdown
//! and load the intermediate hash back into the crypto module after resuming
//! operation.
