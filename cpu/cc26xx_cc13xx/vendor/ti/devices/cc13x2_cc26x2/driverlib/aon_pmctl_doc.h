//! \section sec_aonpmctl Introduction
//!
//! This API provides a set of functions for using the AON Power Management
//! Controller module (AON_PMCTL).
//!
//! The AON_PMCTL module contains the following functional options:
//! - Selection of voltage regulator for the digital domain.
//! - Control of retention of MCU SRAM banks during power off of the BUS power domain.
//! - Control of power and retention of AUX SRAM.
//! - Control of power, reset, and clock for the following domains:
//!   - MCU_VD
//!   - JTAG_PD
//!   - AUX
//! - Control of the recharging of VDDR while in uLDO state.
//! - Control of the generation of a periodic request to the OSCDIG to initiate
//! an XOSC_HF amplitude calibration sequence.
//!
//! The main clock for the AON_PMCTL module is the 2 MHz SCLK MF clock.
//!
//! AON_PMCTL supports the MCU_voltage domain with a 48 MHz clock (SCLK_HF) that is divided
//! and gated by the PRCM module before being distributed to all modules in the
//! MCU voltage domain.
//!
//! The AON_PMCTL controls the SCLK_HF clock to ensure that it is available in the
//! Active and Idle power modes, and disabled for all other modes. SCLK_HF is not
//! allowed in uLDO state since it uses too much power.
//! The SCLK_HF clock is also available for the AUX module in the Active and Idle
//! power modes.
//!
//! The AON_PMCTL selects the clock source for the AUX domain in the different
//! power modes.
//!
//! Main functionality to control power management of the JTAG power domain is
//! supported. Note that no clock control is supported, as the JTAG is clocked
//! on the TCK clock.
//!
//!
//! \section sec_aonpmctl_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Functions to perform status report:
//! - \ref AONPMCTLPowerStatusGet()
//!
//!
//! Functions to perform device configuration:
//! - \ref AONPMCTLJtagPowerOff()
//! - \ref AONPMCTLMcuSRamRetConfig()
//!
//! Please note that due to legacy software compatibility some functionalities controlled
//! by the AON Power Management Controller module are supported through the APIs of
//! the [System Controller](@ref sysctrl_api) and [Power Controller](@ref pwrctrl_api). Relevant functions are:
//! - \ref PowerCtrlSourceGet()
//! - \ref PowerCtrlSourceSet()
//! - \ref PowerCtrlResetSourceGet()
//! - \ref SysCtrl_DCDC_VoltageConditionalControl()
//! - \ref SysCtrlClockLossResetDisable()
//! - \ref SysCtrlClockLossResetEnable()
//! - \ref SysCtrlSystemReset()
//! - \ref SysCtrlResetSourceGet()
//!
//! @}
