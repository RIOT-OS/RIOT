//! \section sec_mcusemaphore Introduction
//!
//! The MCU Semaphore offers 32 semaphores that each can be claimed and released in an atomic operation.
//! One and only one semaphore can be handled during a transaction.
//!
//! Claiming a semaphore causes subsequent claims/reads to return '0' (i.e. "not available").
//! How the semaphores are used and respected is decided by software.
//!
//! \section sec_mcusemaphore_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Semaphore acquire:
//! - \ref SMPHAcquire()
//! - \ref SMPHTryAcquire()
//!
//! Semaphore release:
//! - \ref SMPHRelease()
//!
