//! \section sec_aes Introduction
//!
//! The AES (advanced encryption standard) API provides access to the AES and key
//! store functionality of the crypto core. The SHA2 accelerator is also
//! contained within the crypto core. Hence, only one of SHA2 and AES may be
//! used at the same time.
//! This module offers hardware acceleration for several protocols using the
//! AES block cypher. The protocols below are supported by the hardware. The
//! driverlib documentation only explicitly references the most commonly used ones.
//! - ECB
//! - CBC
//! - CCM
//! - CBC-MAC
//! - GCM
//!
//! The key store is a section of crypto memory that is only accessible to the crypto module
//! and may be written to by the application via the crypto DMA. It is not possible to
//! read from the key store to main memory. Thereby, it is not possible to
//! compromise the key should the application be hacked if the original key in main
//! memory was overwritten already.
//!
//! The crypto core does not have retention and all configuration settings and
//! keys in the keystore are lost when going into standby or shutdown.
//! The typical security advantages a key store offers are not available in these
//! low power modes as the key must be saved in regular memory to reload
//! it after going into standby or shutdown.
//! Consequently, the keystore primarily serves as an interface to the AES accelerator.
