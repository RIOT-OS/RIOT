//! \section sec_gpio Introduction
//!
//! The GPIO module allows software to control the pins of the device directly if the IOC module has
//! been configured to route the GPIO signal to a physical pin (called DIO). Alternatively, pins can
//! be hardware controlled by other peripheral modules. For more information about the IOC module,
//! how to configure physical pins, and how to select between software controlled and hardware controlled,
//! see the [IOC API](\ref ioc_api).
//!
//! The System CPU can access the GPIO module to read the value of any DIO of the device and if the IOC
//! module has been configured such that one or more DIOs are GPIO controlled (software controlled) the
//! System CPU can write these DIOs through the GPIO module.
//!
//! The IOC module can also be configured to generate events on edge detection and these events can be
//! read and cleared in the GPIO module by the System CPU.
//!
//! \section sec_gpio_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Set and get direction of DIO (output enable):
//! - \ref GPIO_setOutputEnableDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_setOutputEnableMultiDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_getOutputEnableDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_getOutputEnableMultiDio()
//!
//! Write DIO (requires IOC to be configured for GPIO usage):
//! - \ref GPIO_writeDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_writeMultiDio()
//!
//! Set, clear, or toggle DIO (requires IOC to be configured for GPIO usage):
//! - \ref GPIO_setDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_setMultiDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_clearDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_clearMultiDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_toggleDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_toggleMultiDio()
//!
//! Read DIO (even if IOC is NOT configured for GPIO usage; however, the DIO must be configured for input enable in IOC):
//! - \ref GPIO_readDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_readMultiDio()
//!
//! Read or clear events (even if IOC is NOT configured for GPIO usage; however, the DIO must be configured for input enable in IOC):
//! - \ref GPIO_getEventDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_getEventMultiDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_clearEventDio()
//! - \ref GPIO_clearEventMultiDio()
//!
//! The [IOC API](\ref ioc_api) provides two functions for easy configuration of DIOs as GPIO enabled using
//! typical settings. They also serve as examples on how to configure the IOC and GPIO modules for GPIO usage:
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeGpioInput()
//! - \ref IOCPinTypeGpioOutput()
//!
//! @}
