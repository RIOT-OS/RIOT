//! \section sec_aonioc Introduction
//!
//! The Input/Output Controller (IOC) controls the functionality of the pins (called DIO).
//! The IOC consists of two APIs:
//! - MCU IOC API selects which peripheral module is connected to the individual DIO and thus allowed to control it.
//!   It also controls individual drive strength, slew rate, pull-up/pull-down, edge detection, etc.
//! - AON IOC API controls the general drive strength definitions, IO latches, and if the LF clock is
//!   routed to a DIO for external use.
//!
//! For more information on the MCU IOC see the [IOC API](\ref ioc_api).
//!
//! \section sec_aonioc_api API
//!
//! The API functions can be grouped like this:
//!
//! Freeze IOs while MCU domain is powered down:
//! - \ref AONIOCFreezeEnable()
//! - \ref AONIOCFreezeDisable()
//!
//! Output LF clock to a DIO:
//! - \ref AONIOC32kHzOutputEnable()
//! - \ref AONIOC32kHzOutputDisable()
//!
//! Configure the value of drive strength for the three manual MCU IOC settings (MIN, MED, MAX):
//! - \ref AONIOCDriveStrengthSet()
//! - \ref AONIOCDriveStrengthGet()
//!
//! @}
