 * @brief       The I2C interface driver definitions for the LPC2387 chip.
 *              The driver is full abstracted supporting all the i2c-interfaces
 *              of the LPC2387 chip. The user need only to give the requested
 *              i2c-interface and the transmission baudrate. The user can
 *              optionally give its own master interrupt handler. If the user
 *              does not declare a handler, an appropriate interrupt is
 *              automatically registered for the specific i2c-interface.
