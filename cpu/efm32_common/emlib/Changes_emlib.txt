================ Revision history ============================================
3.20.6:
 - Corrected fix for Errata EMU_E107.

3.20.5:
 - Updated license texts.
 - Removed unnecessary fix for Wonder Gecko.
 - Updated LFXO temperature compensation in CHIP_Init().
 - Changed LESENSE_ScanStart, LESENSE_ScanStop, LESENSE_DecoderStart,
   LESENSE_ResultBufferClear and LESENSE_Reset functions to wait until
   CMD register writes complete in order to make sure CMD register writes do
   not break each other, and for register values to be consistent when
   returning from functions that write to the CMD register.
 - Added fix for Errata EMU_E107.
 - Added family to SYSTEM_ChipRevision_TypeDef.
 - Fixed bug in function AES_OFB128 which failed on Zero Gecko.
 - Fixed RMU_ResetCauseGet to return correct reset causes.
 - Fixed bug in RTC_CounterReset which failed to reset counter immediately
   after return on Gecko devices.
 - Added static inline non-blocking USART receive functions (USART_Rx...).
 - Added function SYSTEM_GetFamily.
 - Added function DAC_ChannelOutputSet.
 - Fixed MSC_WriteWord to not use WDOUBLE if LPWRITE is set.

3.20.2:
 - Fixed bug regarding when MEMINFO in DEVINFO was introduced.
   The correct crossover is production revision 18.
 - Fixed bug in WDOG_Feed which does not feed the watchdog if the watchdog
   is disabled. Previously, the watchdog was broken after WDOG_Feed fed it
   when it was disabled.
-  Fixed issue in em_i2c.c, which should set the NACK bit in the I2C CMD
   register for the next to last byte received. The exception is when only
   one byte is to be received. Then the NACK bit must be set like the
   previous code was doing.
-  Added function BURTC_ClockFreqGet in order to determine clock frequency
   of BURTC.
-  Fixed bug in BURTC_Reset which made a subsequent call to BURTC_Init hang.
-  Added support for the IDAC module on the Zero Gecko family, em_idac.c/h.
-  Fixed bug in DAC_PrescaleCalc() which could return higher values than
   the maximum prescaler value. The fix makes sure to return the max prescaler
   value resulting in possible higher DAC frequency than requested.
-  Fixed I2C_BusFreqSet to use documented values for Nlow and Nhigh values,
   and do not decrement the div(isor) by one according to the formula because
   this resulted in higher I2C bus frequencies than desired.

3.20.0:
 - LEUART: Added LEUART_TxDmaInEM2Enable and LEUART_RxDmaInEM2Enable for
   enabling and disabling DMA LEUART RX and Tx in EM2 support.

3.0.3:
 - Internal release for testing Wonder Gecko support.
 - SYSTEM: Added function to enable/disable FPU access on Wonder parts,
           SYSTEM_FpuAccessModeSet().
 - USART: Added USART_SpiTransfer() function.

3.0.2:
 - MSC: In MSC_WriteWord, added support for double word write cycle support
   (WDOUBLE) on devices with more than 512KiBytes of Flash memory. This can
   almost double the speed of the MSC_WriteWord function for large data sizes.
 - MSC: In MSC_ErasePage, added support for devices with Flash page size
   larger than 512 bytes, like Giant and Leopard Gecko.
 - CMU: Fixed bug in CMU_ClockDivSet. Clear HFLE and HFCORECLKLEDIV flags when
   the core runs at frequencies up to 32MHz.
 - CMU: Fixed bug in CMU_ClockEnable: Set the HFLE and HFCORECLKLEDIV flags
   when the CORE clock runs at frequencies higher than 32MHz.
 - CMU: Fixed bug in CMU_ClockSelectSet: Set HFLE and DIV4 factor for peripheral
   clock if HFCORE clock for LE is enabled and the CORE clock runs at
   frequencies higher than 32MHz.
 - BITBAND: Added BITBAND_PeripheralRead and BITBAND_SRAMRead functions.
 - DMA: Added #ifndef EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_DMA_IRQ_HANDLER around DMA_IRQHandler in
   order for the user to implement a custom IRQ handler or run without a DMA
   IRQ handler by defining EXCLUDE_DEFAULT_DMA_IRQ_HANDLER with the -D compiler
   option.
 - BURTC: In functions BURTC_Init() and BURTC_CompareSet(), moved SYNCBUSY
   loops in front of modifications of registers COMP0 and LPMODE.
 - MSC: Fixed ram_code section error on Keil toolchain.
 - MSC: Removed uneeded code from MSC init and deinit which would have no
   effect (Big thanks to Martin Schreiber for reporting this bug!).
 - System: Added access functions for reading some values out of the Device
   Information page.

3.0.1:
 - LFXO fix for Giant family.
 - USART: Fix for EFM32TG108Fxx which does not have USART0.
 - EBI: The write to the CTRL register now happens before the ROUTE registers
   are set. This avoids potential glitches.
 - LESENSE: Fix issue when using lesenseAltExMapACMP.
 - TIMER: Fix compilation on devices where ADC is not available.
 - LCD: Fix bug where Aloc field would not be set to 0.
 - BURTC: Fix Reset function by adding reset of COMP0 register and removing
   reset of POWERDOWN register. The POWERDOWN register cannot be used to
   power up the blocks after it has been powered down.
 - CMU: Fixed bug where ClockDivSet, ClockDivGet and ClockFreqGet didn't work for
   cmuClock_LCDpre clock. Also corrected 3 wrongly typed constants.
 - CMU: Fixed bug where LFBE field in LFCLKSEL was not cleared before setting
   bit-value.
 - CMU: Fixed bug with CMU_ClockSelectGet. Did not give correct return value
   for cmuClock_LFB.
 - I2C: Fixed bug where I2C_Init would set divisor depending on the previous
   master/slave configuration, not the one set in the initialization.
 - I2C: Fixed issue in the function I2C_BusFreqSet (called by I2C_Init). The
   input parameter 'I2C_ClockHLR_TypeDef type' was not in use. The fix enables
   the parameter to add support for 'i2cClockHLRAsymetric' and 'i2cClockHLRFast'
   modes. In order to use 'i2cClockHLRAsymetric' and 'i2cClockHLRFast' the
   frequency of the HFPER clock may need to be increased.
 - OPAMP: Fixed bug in the function OPAMP_Enable where an incorrect register
   was used when setting the OPA2 calibration value.
 - LEUART: Fixed issue in LEUART_BaudrateSet when a high clock frequency and a
   low baudrate can overflow the clock divisor register (CLKDIV). The fix uses
   an assert statement to check whether the calculated clock divisor is out of
   range.
 - USART: Fixed issue in USART_BaudrateAsyncSet when a high clock frequency and
   a low baudrate can overflow the clock divisor register (CLKDIV). The fix uses
   an assert statement to check whether the calculated clock divisor is out of
   range.
