 * @file em_assert.h
 * @brief EFM32 peripheral API "assert" implementation.
 * @version 3.20.6
 *
 * @details
 * By default, EFM32 library assert usage is not included in order to reduce
 * footprint and processing overhead. Further, EFM32 assert usage is decoupled
 * from ISO C assert handling (NDEBUG usage), to allow a user to use ISO C
 * assert without including EFM32 assert statements.
 *
 * Below are available defines for controlling EFM32 assert inclusion. The defines
 * are typically defined for a project to be used by the preprocessor.
 *
 * @li If DEBUG_EFM is defined, the internal EFM32 library assert handling will
 * be used, which may be a quite rudimentary implementation.
 *
 * @li If DEBUG_EFM_USER is defined instead, the user must provide its own EFM32
 * assert handling routine (assertEFM()).
 *
 * As indicated above, if none of the above defines are used, EFM32 assert
 * statements are not compiled.
