 * @brief Error checking module.
 * @details
 * By default, EMLIB library assert usage is not included in order to reduce
 * footprint and processing overhead. Further, EMLIB assert usage is decoupled
 * from ISO C assert handling (NDEBUG usage), to allow a user to use ISO C
 * assert without including EMLIB assert statements.
 *
 * Below are available defines for controlling EMLIB assert inclusion. The defines
 * are typically defined for a project to be used by the preprocessor.
 *
 * @li If @ref DEBUG_EFM is defined, the internal EMLIB library assert handling will
 * be used. This is implemented as a simple while(true) loop. @ref DEBUG_EFM is not
 * defined by default.
 *
 * @li If DEBUG_EFM_USER is defined instead, the user must provide their own
 * implementation of the assertEFM() function.
 *
 * @li If both @ref DEBUG_EFM and DEBUG_EFM_USER are undefined then all EFM_ASSERT()
 * statements are no operation.
 *
 * @note
 * The internal EMLIB assert is documented here because @ref DEBUG_EFM is defined in
 * the doxygen configuration.
