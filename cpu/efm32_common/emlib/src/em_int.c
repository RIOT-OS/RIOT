 * @brief Safe nesting interrupt disable/enable API
 * @{
 * @details
 *  This module contains functions to safely disable and enable interrupts
 *  at cpu level. INT_Disable() disables interrupts and increments a lock
 *  level counter. INT_Enable() decrements the lock level counter and enable
 *  interrupts if the counter was decremented to zero.
 *
 *  These functions would normally be used to secure critical regions.
 *
 *  These functions should also be used inside interrupt handlers:
 *  @verbatim
 *  void SysTick_Handler(void)
 *  {
 *    INT_Disable();
 *      .
 *      .
 *      .
 *    INT_Enable();
 *  }
 * @endverbatim
