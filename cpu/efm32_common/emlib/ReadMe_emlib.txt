================ Silicon Labs Peripheral Library ============================

This directory, "emlib", contains the Silicon Labs Peripheral Support
library for the EFM32 series of microcontrollers and EFR4 series for RF
transceivers and System-On-Chip devices.

The "emlib" SW is designed to support all Silicon Labs EFM and EFR devices,
from Gecko revision B and forward.

Some design guidelines for this library:

* Follow the guidelines established by ARM's and Silicon Labs's adaptation
  of the CMSIS (see below) standard.

* Be usable as a starting point for developing richer, more target specific
  functionality (i.e. copy and modify further).

* Ability to be used as a standalone software component, to be used by other
  drivers, that should cover "the most common cases".

* Readability of the code and usability preferred before optimization for speed
  and size or covering a particular "narrow" purpose.

* As little "cross-dependency" between modules as possible, to enable users to
  pick and choose what they want.

================ About CMSIS ================================================

These APIs are based on EFM32_CMSIS "Device" header file structure.

As a result of this, the library requires basic C99-support. You might have
to enable C99 support in your compiler. Comments are in doxygen compatible
format.

The EFM32_CMSIS library contains all peripheral module registers and bit field
descriptors.
