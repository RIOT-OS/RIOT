     *
     * There are some foot guns to take into account:
     *
     * 1. The LFXT1 clock is only monitored in high speed mode. So for the
     *    typical setup of using a 32.768 kHz watch crystal one can only wait
     *    for some preconfigured static value and hope this was long enough
     *    to stabilize. (But that seems to work fine in practise.)
     * 2. If no high speed crystal is in use (e.g. LFXT1 is used with a
     *    watch crystal and XT2 is not connected), the fault flag will
     *    stick and cannot be cleared. Waiting for the flag to clear would
     *    result in getting stuck during boot.
     *
     * Because of 1, we go for best effort by just waiting UINT16_MAX busy
     * loops for the watch crystal to stabilize. This is common practise and
     * seems to work just fine.
     * Because of 2 we don't wait for OFIFG if no high speed crystal is in use.
     *
     * We wait for watch crystal first, as chances are good that by then the
     * high speed crystal (if any) is stable or about to become stable as well,
     * so that the second wait is fast.
