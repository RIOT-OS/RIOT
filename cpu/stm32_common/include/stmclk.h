/**
 * @brief   Configure the high speed clock domain (main system clock)
 *
 * This function initializes and configures the main systems clock(s). For this,
 * the following actions are carried out:
 * - enable the HSI
 * - use the HSI as system clock (so now we are always in a defined state)
 * - configure flash wait states and AHB/APB bus dividers
 * - [opt] enable the HSE / MSI
 * - configure the PLL
 * - use PLL as system clock
 * - turn off the HSI if unused
 *
 * All of these options are configurable through the board's periph_conf.h
