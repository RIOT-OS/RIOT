apart from all the RIoT-related stuff, you need to supply headers (and iomux-init-code) for the SDK this i.MX6-port is based on
You can do this by either:
-copying the files from the riotboard
-generating your own with the iomux-tool from freescale
-implementing all necessary functions/macros yourself

in board/riotboard/tools is a tool for pulling the generated sources into the riotboard-structure but you can put them whereever you want. Just make sure the headers are on the include-path and the sources are compiled.
