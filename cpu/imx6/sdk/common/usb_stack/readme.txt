The USB stack in this directory is version 4.0.3 of the Freescale bare-metal (No OS) USB stack.

The main web page for the USB stack is here:

Support for other chip families and compilers has been removed to reduce the number of files.
Also, only the USB device stack is included at the moment. Host support will be added in a
future release of the Platform SDK.
