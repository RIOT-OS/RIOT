This library is really just two files: 'tinyprintf.h' and 'tinyprintf.c'.

They provide a simple and small (+400 loc) printf functionality to
be used in embedded systems.

I've found them so useful in debugging that I do not bother with a
debugger at all.

They are distributed in source form, so to use them, just compile them
into your project.

Two printf variants are provided: printf and the 'sprintf' family of
functions ('snprintf', 'sprintf', 'vsnprintf', 'vsprintf').

The formats supported by this implementation are:
'c' 'd' 'i' 'o' 'p' 'u' 's' 'x' 'X'.

Zero padding and field width are also supported.

If the library is compiled with 'PRINTF_SUPPORT_LONG' defined, then
the long specifier is also supported. Note that this will pull in some
long math routines (pun intended!) and thus make your executable
noticeably longer. Likewise with 'PRINTF_LONG_LONG_SUPPORT' for the
long long specifier, and with 'PRINTF_SIZE_T_SUPPORT' for the size_t
specifier.

The memory footprint of course depends on the target CPU, compiler and
compiler options, but a rough guesstimate (based on a H8S target) is about
1.4 kB for code and some twenty 'int's and 'char's, say 60 bytes of stack space.
Not too bad. Your mileage may vary. By hacking the source code you can
get rid of some hundred bytes, I'm sure, but personally I feel the balance of
functionality and flexibility versus  code size is close to optimal for
many embedded systems.

To use the printf, you need to supply your own character output function,
something like :

void putc ( void* p, char c)
{
    while (!SERIAL_PORT_EMPTY) ;
    SERIAL_PORT_TX_REGISTER = c;
}

Before you can call printf, you need to initialize it to use your
character output function with something like:

init_printf(NULL,putc);

Notice the 'NULL' in 'init_printf' and the parameter 'void* p' in 'putc',
the NULL (or any pointer) you pass into the 'init_printf' will eventually be
passed to your 'putc' routine. This allows you to pass some storage space (or
anything really) to the character output function, if necessary.
This is not often needed but it was implemented like that because it made
implementing the sprintf function so neat (look at the source code).

The code is re-entrant, except for the 'init_printf' function, so it is safe
to call it from interrupts too, although this may result in mixed output.
If you rely on re-entrancy, take care that your 'putc' function is re-entrant!

The printf and sprintf functions are actually macros that translate to
'tfp_printf' and 'tfp_sprintf' when 'TINYPRINTF_OVERRIDE_LIBC' is set
(default). Setting it to 0 makes it possible to use them along with
'stdio.h' printf's in a single source file. When
'TINYPRINTF_OVERRIDE_LIBC' is set, please note that printf/sprintf are
not function-like macros, so if you have variables or struct members
with these names, things will explode in your face.  Without variadic
macros this is the best we can do to wrap these function. If it is a
problem, just give up the macros and use the functions directly, or
rename them.

It is also possible to avoid defining tfp_printf and/or tfp_sprintf by
clearing 'TINYPRINTF_DEFINE_TFP_PRINTF' and/or
'TINYPRINTF_DEFINE_TFP_SPRINTF' to 0. This allows for example to
export only tfp_format, which is at the core of all the other
functions.

For further details see source code.
