/**
 * @ brief Internal Interrupt numbers
 *
 * MIPS cores have a few internally generated interrupts from the Timer,
 * Performance Counters and Fast Debug Channel hardware, in EIC mode these
 * become outputs from the core and are connected to the external controller,
 * the external control then loops these back at whichever IPL it decides
 *
 * We use negative numbers to represent these, leaving positive numbers free for
 * the SoC specific interrupts
