/**
 * @brief Enable Cortex-M sub-priorities, with the given number of bits
 *
 * Cortex-M CPUs allow interrupt priorities to be arranged in subgroups,
 * meaning that any interrupts on the same subgroup will not
 * pre-empt each other, but those on a lower sub-priority will run
 * only once all on the higher sub-priorities have been completed.
 *
 * The usual practice on Cortex-M is to run the PendSV interrupt
 * as the last one, just before returning to the user context,
 * running the scheduler from PendSV.  However, in RIOT we don't want
 * the scheduler to be interrupted by any "normal" interrupts, which
 * may change the mutexes or something else that would affect the
 * scheduler.  At the same time, we don't want to explicitly
 * disable all interrupts while in the scheduler, as that would
 * increase scheduling latency.
 *
 * A currently experimental way to make PendSV on Cortex-M to run
 * last is to
 * - make sure @ref CPU_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIO is even (e.g. `6U`),
 * - set @ref CPU_CORTEXM_PENDSV_IRQ_PRIO to one higher, and
 * - set this one
 *
 * For example, as follows:
 * @code{.c}
 * # define CPU_CORTEXM_PRIORITY_GROUPING (1U)
 * # define CPU_CORTEXM_PENDSV_IRQ_PRIO   (CPU_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIO + 1U)
 * @endcode
 *
 * See cpu/cortexm_common/cortexm_init.c how these are used.
 *
 * If you want to set this, define it in your `cpu_conf.h`.

/**
 * @brief Define a separate priority for the PendSV interrupt
 *
 * According to the ARM Cortex-M documentation, the recommended best
 * practice is to place the PendSV at the lowest interrupt priority.
 * By default, RIOT runs PendSV on the same interrupt priority with all
 * other interrupts.
 *
 * For efficency (or other reasons), one may want to run the PendSV as
 * the last one, just before returning to the (next) thread.  However,
 * since PendSV triggers the RIOT scheduler _without_ interrupts being
 * disabled, any interrupts that pre-empt the scheduler, including the
 * timer interrupts, must not call anything that may affect the
 * scheduler, such as mutex or scheduler functions.  With the current
 * design of RIOT, writing interrupt handlers in such a manner is not
 * exactly trivial.
 *
 * An experimental way to to run PendSV as the last thing before
 * returning to the user thread context is to enable Cortex-M
 * sub-priorities with @ref CPU_CORTEXM_PRIORITY_GROUPING and then
 * make the PendSV interrupt sub-priority lower than the default.
 * (Remember, on Cortex-M lower urgency means higher priority number.)
 *
 * For now, by default, we preserve the traditional RIOT behaviour, but
 * allow specific CPUs, boards, or apps to change this.
 *
 * See cpu/cortexm_common/cortexm_init.c how these are used.
 *
 * If you want to set this, define it in your `cpu_conf.h`.
