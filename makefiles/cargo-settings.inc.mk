# BINDIR, for that would allow different boards using the same CPU to share
# compiled code (unless they they build conditionally on environment variables,
# like riot-sys does). This is not done for two reasons:
#
# * Overriding BINDIR (like is done in Murdock) would not take effect,
#   requiring additional overrides to enable out-of-tree building.
#
# * Switching back and forth between two boards of the same CPU requires
#   riot-sys rebuilds. (On its own, this would be outweighed by the shared
#   compilation of other modules).
