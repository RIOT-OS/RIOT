# Target architecture for the build.

# The correct triple for 32 bit embedded RISC-V targets is "riscv32-none-elf".
# However, is unknown is used as sys (in place of none), it will also fall back
# to none. Finally, if the GCC RISC-V cross compiler is compiled with full
# multilib support, it can create both 32 bit and 64 bit binaries. Often this is
# indicated with "riscv" being used instead of "riscv32/riscv64", but e.g.
# Ubuntu uses "riscv64-unknown-elf" despite being able to produce both 32 and
# 64 bit binaries. We'll test all possible combinations from the most correct
# triple to the least correct triple all that might be able to produce our
# binaries. Finally, "riscv-none-embed" is also tested for compatibility with
# an previously popular legacy toolchain.
# For a CI transition period, it is tested first.
