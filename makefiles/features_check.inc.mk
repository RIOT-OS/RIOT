#     - Store the intersection of FEATURES_USED_SO_FAR and the features in
#       "item" in "tmp"
#     - Append the intersection of FEATURES_USABLE and the features in "item"
#       to "tmp"
#     - Append "item" to "tmp" (with pipes between features, e.g.
#       "periph_spi|periph_i2c")
#     - Append the first element of "tmp" to FEATURES_REQUIRED_ONE_OUT_OF
#   ==> If one (or more) already used features is listed in item, this (or
#       one of these) will be in the front of "tmp" and be taken
#   ==> If one (or more) usable features is listed in item, this will come
#       afterwards. If no no feature in item is used so for, one of the
#       features supported and listed in item will be picked
#   ==> At the end of the list item itself (with pipes between features) is the
#       last item in "tmp". If no feature is item is supported or used, this
#       will be the only item in "tmp" and be picked
