#
# Parameters
#   features-list: list of list of '|' separated features
#     e.g.: "periph_spi|periph_i2c puf_sram|periph_hwrng"
#   whitelist: possible features to select one out of

#
# One out of Algorithm:
#  - For each list in features-list as "item":
#     - Store the intersection of features-whitelist and the features in
#       "item" in "tmp"
#     - Append "item" to "tmp" (with pipes between features, e.g.
#       "periph_spi|periph_i2c")
#     - Appends the first's element of "tmp" to the caller
#   ==> If one (or more) features in whitelist is listed in item, the first
#       one will be taken.
#   ==> At the end of the list item itself (with pipes between features) is the
#       last item in "tmp". If no feature in the feature-list is in whitelist
#       this will be the only item in "tmp" and be picked
