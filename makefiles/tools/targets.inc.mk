# This file contains a collection of targets defined by tools shipped with RIOT.
# The reason for keeping those targets separated from their tool Makfiles is
# that these targets have to be defined after the default build targets
# (as `all`), so `all` will always be the first target defined and thereby the
# default target when `make` is called without any further argument.

# target for building the bossac binary
