# Force the C compiler to not ignore signed integer overflows

#               Branches that rely on this undefined behaviour will be silently
#               optimized out. For details, have a look at
#               https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30475
# Note:         Please do not add new code that relies on this undefined
