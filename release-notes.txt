RIOT-2014.12 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: from 8-bit
microcontrollers to light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#426: Interrupt handling on MSP430 is buggy
    Several fixes by @rousselk
#1798: core: first thread on runqueue is scheduled twice
    Was fixed along with the thread_yield() refactoring
#1127: Random build fails on OSX
    native is building stable also on OSX now

Known Issues
============
network related issues
----------------------
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.
#1577: ccn-lite: populate does not work with disabled cache
    If cache is set to zero, the chunks cannot be loaded and therefore also not get populated.
#1870: IPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed
    According to Wireshark, ICMPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed (wrong
    checksum or other reasons).

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.


other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.
#1442: setting channel is not persistent cc2420
    After changing the channel via a shell command, the channel reverts back to an arbitrary
    value. However, this might be only a shell problem.
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20"
    dependent on the platform, vtimer stops working after some time.
#1891: printf formatting does not work properly on some Cortex platforms for 64 bit numbers
    This problem happens mostly for the Newlib nano, which does not support 64 bit integer
    printing, but sometimes happens also with other toolchains.
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    The shell is sometimes not properly working after a reboot and the PDR is sometimes
    worse than expected.
#2143: tests.core doesn't compile for all platforms
    For some missing GCC compiler builtins, the unittests do not compile for MSP430
    platforms.
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The application examples/default for example will crash when issuing the txtsnd command

other issues:
--------------
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    The timer callback might still fire even after vtimer_remove() was called.
#2175: valgrind registeres "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests for ubjson
     According to valgrind the stack gets corrupted in UBJSON.
