RIOT-2019.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2019.04 release includes a number of new features including porting of
riotboot to a number of new platforms, 802.15.4 support on the nRF52, and the
ability for firmware to flash images into a separate boot slot. Support for
several new boards and new sensors was added. Additionally, this release
contains a number of bug fixes and test improvements.

About 320 pull requests with about 569 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 40 issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code
in 88 days. Approximately 825 files have been touched with 32716 insertions
and 5149 deletions.

RIOT-2018.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2018.10 release includes new features, like CoAP Resource Directory and
Block2, ESP32 support, rework of I2C interface, EEPROM registry,
Full and Minimal Thread Devices support in OpenThread and compliance of
LoRaWAN 1.0.2 (ABP counters stored in EEPROM). Several boards were introduced.

During the last release the board documentation was migrated from the wiki to
the [RIOT API documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org) to improve the
maintenance of these entries and provide a better user experience when
browsing the documentation. There were also some efforts in grouping some
modules to make them easier to access in the documentation.

There were also some efforts on refactoring, test improvements and bug fixes.

About 392 pull requests with about 914 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 20 issues have been solved. 57 people contributed with code
in 100 days. Approximately 2184 files have been touched with 211964 insertions
and 34806 deletions.

RIOT-2018.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2018.07 release includes new features, like NimBLE (ble stack),
a MQTT-SN client, SHA-1 based PRNG, an UUID implementation. The RISC-V CPU
architecture support used by the hifive1 board.
Effort was done on refactoring, documentation, test improvements and bug fixes.

During the last release, maintainers contributed by running the automated test
suites on their boards. This gave valuable feedback on the board support state,
test reliability and where to focus effort to make testing easier and more
reliable.

About 380 pull requests with about 675 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 27 issues have been solved. 45 people contributed with code
in 93 days. Approximately 1678 files have been touched with 147122 insertions
and 16060 deletions.

About this release:
===================
The 2018.04 release includes major progress in support for current crypto
libraries.  A lot of work has gone into updating drivers to RIOT's unified
configuration scheme.  Support for ten new boards has been added.  In our quest
to improve and automate testing, many test scripts have been fixed and
improved, and RIOT's CI now runs many tests on real hardware during its nightly
build testing. And as usual, many tiny fixes and improvements have been merged.

About 390 pull requests with about 1073 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 54 issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code
in 98 days. Approximately 1491 files have been touched with 208426 insertions.

About this release:
===================
The 2018.01 release includes major progress in RIOTs network communication
capabilities, i.e., rewrite of GNRC's neighbour discovery, confirmable messages
in (g)CoAP, LoRa, and GoMacH as well as updates on CCN-lite and LWIP.
Furthermore, RIOT contributes to _IKEA-Hacking_ by bringing support for
the smart home lighting system TRADFRI (note: this will void the warranty).
Needless to say that this release also adds and updates support for several
platforms, drivers, and of course lots of enhancements to the documentation
as well as numerous bug fixes. Last but not least, RIOT now has an official
code of conduct (https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

More than 442 pull requests with about 865 commits have been merged since the
last release and about 96 issues have been solved. 54 people contributed with code
in 96 days. Approximately 2370 files have been touched with 223970 insertions

RIOT-2017.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit
microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
Most notable, this release is bringing RIOT a step closer to supporting
over-the-air-updates by containing initial support for MCUBoot.
Furthermore, it adds support for some new platforms (e.g. arduino-mkzero,
nucleos, and frdm-k22f), drivers (e.g. my9221, apa102, ds1307), and of course
a large number of bug fixes (e.g. `make buildtest` now working properly,
various fixes to `xtimer`).

About 390 pull requests with about 500 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 60 issues have been solved. 39 people contributed with code
in 113 days. 1825 files have been touched with 223454 insertions and 66146 deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last 3 releases (known issues missing in 2017.04 and 2017.07)
===================================================================================
#2006: cpu/nrf51822: timer callback may be fired too early
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list:
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#4694: drivers/lm75a: does not build
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5128: make: buildtest breaks when exporting FEATURES_PROVIDED var
#5207: make: buildest fails with board dependent application Makefiles
#5361: cpu/cc26x0: timer broken

#5489: cpu/lpc11u34: ADC broken
#5799: kw2x: 15.4 duplicate transmits
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in there board_init()
       function. The xtimer is however first initialized in the auto_init module which is executed
       after board_init()
#6022: pkg: build order issue

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision
       which is not required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#4048: gnrc: potential racey memory leak
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some operations mutexes to the
       network interfaces need to get unlocked in the current implementation to not get deadlocked.
       Recursive mutexes as provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of size ~512 B might lead
       to crashes. The issue describes this for several hundret nodes, but agressive flooding with
       just two nodes was also shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame gets lost the reassembly
       state machine might get out of sync
#6123: gnrc: crash with (excessive) traffic
#7035: lwIP: hangs due to sema change after a while
#7737: pkg: libcoap is partially broken and outdated

NDP is not working properly
---------------------------
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router solicitation might lead
       to invalid zero-length link-layer addresses in neighbor cache.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address: Under some  circumstances a router might
       send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored on receive (as RFC-4861 specifies), RAs should have
       link-local addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while: Several issues
       (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address effectively being banned from the network
       (disappears from neighbor cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by outdated ncache at router
#5539: Border Router: packet not forwarded from ethos to interface 6
#5790: ND: Lost of Global IPV6 on node after sending lot of UDP frame from BR

Timer related issues
--------------------
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe for non-32-bit platforms.
#6052: tests: xtimer_drift gets stuck: xtimer_drift application freezes after ~30-200 seconds
#6502: cpu/stm32l1: RTC broken
#7114: xtimer: add's items to the wrong list if the timer overflows between _xtimer_now() and irq_disable()

native related issues
---------------------
#495:  native not float safe: When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either
       the stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#2175: ubjson: valgind registers "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests
#5796: native: tlsf: early malloc will lead to a crash: TLSF needs pools to be initialized (which is
       currently expected to be done in an application). If a malloc is needed before an application's
       main started (e.g. driver initialization) the node can crash, since no pool is allocated yet.
#6145: native: system reboots on SIGTRAP
#6442: cpu/native: timer interrupt does not yield thread
#7206: native: race-condition in IPC

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1891: newlib-nano: Printf formatting does not work properly for some numeric types: PRI[uxdi]64,
       PRI[uxdi]8 and float are not parsed in newlib-nano
#2143: unittests: tests-core doesn't compile for all platforms: GCC build-ins were used in the
       unittests which are not available with msp430-gcc
#2300: qemu unittest fails because of a page fault
#4512: pkg: tests: RELIC unittests fail on iotlab-m3
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc oonf_api is not building with clang (partly fixed by #4593)
#4822: kw2xrf: packet loss when packets get fragmented
#4876: at86rf2xx: Simultaneous use of different transceiver types is not supported
#4954: chronos: compiling with -O0 breaks
#4866: not all GPIO driver implementations are thread safe: Due to non-atomic operations in the drivers
       some pin configurations might get lost.
#5009: RIOT is saw-toothing in energy consumption (even when idling)
#5103: xtimer: weird behavior of tests/xtimer_drift: xtimer_drift randomly jumps a few seconds on nrf52
#5405: Eratic timings on iotlab-m3 with compression context activated
#5486: at86rf2xx: lost interrupts
#5678: at86rf2xx: failed assertion in _isr
#5944: msp430: ipv6_hdr unittests fail
#5848: arduino: Race condition in sys/arduino/Makefile.include
#6018: nRF52 gnrc 6lowpan ble memory leak
#6261: SAMD21 TC3 & TC4 issue when using TCC2

#6437: periph/spi: Leftovers from SPI rework
#6526: atmega based boards freeze when main thread is over
#6836: Issuing a reboot on ATmega328p makes the board loop-reboot
#7347: xtimer_usleep stuck for small values on nucleo-l1
#7753: pic32-wifire: race-condition when linking in concurrent build
#7846: stm32f1: I2C read functions return bogus values with unconnected devices

other issues
------------

#3256: make: Setting constants on compile time doesn't really set them everywhere
#3366: periph/i2c: handle NACK
#4488: Making the newlib thread-safe: When calling puts/printf after thread_create(), the CPU hangs
       for DMA enabled uart drivers.
#5561: C++11 extensions in header files
#5776: make: Predefining CFLAGS are parsed weirdly
#5863: OSX +  SAMR21-xpro: shell cannot handle command inputs larger than 64 chars
#5962: Makefile: UNDEF variable is not working as documented
#6451: Wrong value in SRF08 driver
#7800: CBOR is broken

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features, fixes and enhancements. Among others these features
contain an initial - still experimental - TCP implementation based on the GNRC network stack, support
for reading from and writing to SD cards, a new power management architecture as well additional third
party packages such as TweetNaCl, a cryptographic library, and Heatshrink a data compression library
optimized for embedded real-time systems.
We added support for new platforms including the Calliope mini, Maple mini, and a couple of STMs
Nucleo boards. Device support was extended by several new drivers, e.g., for NXP PN532 NFC, Microchip
MRF24J40 802.15.4 radio (experimental), or Bosch BME280 pressure/humidity/temperature sensor.
We completely refactored the SPI interface, allowing for internally handled hardware or software chip
select lines and shared bus usage for multiple devices with different SPI configurations.

About 278 pull requests with about 606 commits have been merged since the last release and about 84
issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code in 87 days. 2230 files have been touched with

#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision
       which is not required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#4048: potential racey memory leak: According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast

#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of size ~512 B might lead
       to crashes. The issue describes this for several hundret nodes, but agressive flooding with
       just two nodes was also shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame gets lost the reassembly
       state machine might get out of sync
#6123: gnrc: crash with (excessive) traffic

NDP is not working properly
---------------------------
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router solicitation might lead
       to invalid zero-length link-layer addresses in neighbor cache.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address: Under some  circumstances a router might
       send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored on receive (as RFC-4861 specifies), RAs should have
       link-local addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while: Several issues
       (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address effectively being banned from the network
       (disappears from neighbor cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by outdated ncache at router
#5539: Border Router: packet not forwarded from ethos to interface 6
#5790: ND: Lost of Global IPV6 on node after sending lot of UDP frame from BR

Timer related issues
--------------------
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list: Under some conditions an xtimer can end up twice in the
       internal list of the xtimer module
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe for non-32-bit platforms.
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in there board_init()
       function. The xtimer is however first initialized in the auto_init module which is executed
       after board_init()
#6052: tests: xtimer_drift gets stuck: xtimer_drift application freezes after ~30-200 seconds
#6331: RTC alarm triggered with 1s delay
#6419: cpu/cc2538: timer broken
#6427: xtimer: infinite loop with xtimer_mutex_lock_timeout
#6502: cpu/stm32l1: RTC broken
#6542: boards/nucle-f0xx: misconfigured timer configuration (fix in #6494)

native related issues
---------------------
#495:  native not float safe: When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either
       the stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#2175: ubjson: valgind registers "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#5796: native: tlsf: early malloc will lead to a crash: TLSF needs pools to be initialized (which is
       currently expected to be done in an application). If a malloc is needed before an application's
       main started (e.g. driver initialization) the node can crash, since no pool is allocated yet.
#6145: native: system reboots on SIGTRAP
#6442: cpu/native: timer interrupt does not yield thread

other platform related issues

RIOT-2016.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by
RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features as well as it  fixes several major
bugs. Among these new features are the new simplified network socket API
called sock, the GNRC specific CoAP implementation gcoap and several new
packages: TinyDTLS, the Aversive++ microcontroller library for robotics, the
u8g2 graphic library, and nanocoap.
Using the new sock API an implementation of the Simple Time Network Protocol
(SNTP) was also introduced, allowing for time synchronization between nodes.
New platforms include the Arduino Uno, the Arduino Duemilanove, the Arduino
Zero, SODAQ Autonomo, and the Zolertia remote (rev. B).
The most significant bug fix was done in native which led to a significantly
more robust handling of ISRs and now allows for at least 1,000 native
instances running stably on one machine.

About 263 pull requests with about 398 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 42 issues have been solved. 37 people contributed with code
in 100 days. 1006 files have been touched with 166500 insertions and 26926
deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#534:  native debugging on osx fails
#2071: native: *long* overdue fixes
#3341: netdev_tap crashes when hammered
#5007: gnrc icmpv6: Ping reply goes out the wrong interface
#5432: native: valgrind fails

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values
       of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing to lower
       precision would save some memory.
#4048: potential racey memory leak: According to the packet buffer stats,
       flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a memory leak due to
       a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a completely
       filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#4388: POSIX sockets: open socket is bound to a specific thread: This was an
       inherit problem of the conn API under GNRC. Since the POSIX sockets are
       still based on conn for this release, this issue persists
#4527: gnrc_ipv6: Multicast is not forwarded if routing node listens to the
       address (might still be fixable for release, see #5729, #5230: gnrc
       ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers)
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5055: cpuid: multiple radios will get same EUI-64 Nodes with multiple
       interfaces might get the same EUI-64 for them since they are generated
       from the same CPU ID.
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some
       operations mutexes to the network interfaces need to get unlocked in
       the current implementation to not get deadlocked. Recursive mutexes as
       provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of
       size ~512 B might lead to crashes. The issue describes this for several
       hundret nodes, but agressive flooding with just two nodes was also
       shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame
       gets lost the reassembly state machine might get out of sync

### NDP is not working properly
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router

       addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while:
       Several issues (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address
       effectively being banned from the network (disappears from neighbor
       cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by

RIOT-2016.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community)
and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release adds support for two additional network stacks: lwIP and emb6.
A bunch of additional protocols are now available, P2P-RPL in the GNRC
network stack, Ethernet-over-Serial (ethos). Murdock, the new, blazing fast
RIOT CI is now available to significantly speed up code merging procedures.

This release also adds support for a number of new boards and sensors and a new
tool for automated border router setup is now provided which greatly simplifies
that setup for newbies as well as for old-timers. Last but not least: this
release includes a number of bug fixes, mostly about stabilizing and enhancing
the networking capabilities of RIOT.

About 470 pull requests with about 1196 commits have been merged since the last
release and 127 additional issues have been solved. 55 people contributed code
in 124 days. 1521 files have been touched with ~91700 insertions and ~42200
deletions.

* genrand_* -> random_*
* xtimer_remove() no longer returns whether a timer was actually removed
* disableIRQ(), enableIRQ(), restoreIRQ(), inISR() -> irq_disable(), irq_enable(), irq_restore(), irq_is_in()
* renamed periph/random to periph/hwrng

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
* #3109: periph/random: random_read should return unsigned int
* #3970: RPL: Advertise DODAG only over the assigned interface
* #4462: IPHC/NHC broken between Linux and a RIOT node with a RIOT-based border router in between.
* #4608: tests/xtimer_usleep_until: unstable behaviour

Known Issues
==========
----------------------
* #3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision
    NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing
    to lower precision would save some memory.
* #3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
    The size of the link-layer header is not dynamically calculated, but instead the maximum
    size is always assumed.
* #4048: potential racey memory leak
    According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a
    memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a
    completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
* #5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address
    Under some circumstances a router might send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored
    on receive (as RFC 4861 specifies), RAs should have link-local addresses and not even
    be send out this way.
* #5007: gnrc icmpv6: Ping reply goes out the wrong interface
* #5055: cpuid: multiple radios will get same EUI-64
    Nodes with multiple interfaces might get the same EUI-64 for them since they are generated
    from the same CPU ID
* #5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers
* #5388: gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc_nhc: receiving NHC compressed UDP packets hits assert in IPv6
    Fix already provided in #5281, but did not made it into the release due to its complexity
* #5390: pkg: OpenWSN does not compile
    This package still uses deprecated modules and was not tested for a long time

native related issues
---------------------
* #495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
* #534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
* #3341 and #3824: nativenet crashes when hammered
    Flood-pinging a native instance from more than one host (either multiple threads on the
    host system or multiple other native instances), leads to a SEGFAULT

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
* #4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc
    oonf_api is not building with clang.
* #4583: cpp11: clang doesn't allow `mutex_t` to be used with `constexpr`
    All cpp11-* tests fail with clang.
* #4866: not all GPIO driver implementations are thread safe
    Due to non-atomic operations in the drivers some pin configurations might get lost

other issues
------------
* #1263: TLSF implementation contains (a) read-before-write error(s)
* #2761: core: define default flags
    If a thread is created without the corresponding flag  (CREATE_STACKTEST),
    the ps command will yield wrong numbers for the stack usage
* #2927: core: Automatically select the lowest possible LPM mode
    Not all available low power modes (LPMs) are implemented for each platform and the
    concept of how the LPM is chosen needs some reconsideration
* #2967: Makefile.features: location is not relevant for all features
    Provided features for the build system should be split up into a board and cpu specific
    part
* #4488: Making the newlib thread-safe
    When calling puts/printf after thread_create(), the CPU hangs for DMA enabled uart drivers.
* #4841: xtimer: timer already in the list
    Under some conditions an xtimer can end up twice in the internal list of the xtimer module.
* #5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe
    For non-32-bit platforms

RIOT-2015.12 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).

About this release:
===================
This release is mostly a clean-up and bug-fixing release. Besides that, it introduces SAUL,
the [S]ensor [A]ctuator [U]ber [L]ayer, which offers a unified API to interact with all
different types of sensors and actuators on RIOT supported hardware. Furthermore, it re-enables
the support for ICN by integrating CCN-Lite as a package. A lot of new overall documentation was
added and existing documentation was improved (http://riot-os.org/api/). In addition,
a Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration file was added to the RIOT repository in
order to create reproducible and portable environments that contain all necessary toolchains.

About 222 pull requests with about 631 commits have been merged since the last release and 48
additional issues have been solved. 37 people contributed code in 102 days. 980 files have been
touched with ~59779 insertions and ~12115 deletions.

    Several fixes by @rousselk
#1798: core: first thread on runqueue is scheduled twice
    Was fixed along with the thread_yield() refactoring
#1127: Random build fails on OSX
    native is building stable also on OSX now

Known Issues
============
network related issues
----------------------
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.
#1577: ccn-lite: populate does not work with disabled cache
    If cache is set to zero, the chunks cannot be loaded and therefore also not get populated.
#1870: IPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed
    According to Wireshark, ICMPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed (wrong
    checksum or other reasons).

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.


other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.
#1442: setting channel is not persistent cc2420
    After changing the channel via a shell command, the channel reverts back to an arbitrary
    value. However, this might be only a shell problem.
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20"
    dependent on the platform, vtimer stops working after some time.
#1891: printf formatting does not work properly on some Cortex platforms for 64 bit numbers
    This problem happens mostly for the Newlib nano, which does not support 64 bit integer
    printing, but sometimes happens also with other toolchains.
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    The shell is sometimes not properly working after a reboot and the PDR is sometimes
    worse than expected.
#2143: tests.core doesn't compile for all platforms
    For some missing GCC compiler builtins, the unittests do not compile for MSP430
    platforms.
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The application examples/default for example will crash when issuing the txtsnd command

other issues:
--------------
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    The timer callback might still fire even after vtimer_remove() was called.
#2175: valgrind registeres "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests for ubjson
     According to valgrind the stack gets corrupted in UBJSON.
