RIOT-2015.12 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).

About this release:
===================
This release is mostly a clean-up and bug-fixing release. Besides that, it introduces SAUL,
the [S]ensor [A]ctuator [U]ber [L]ayer, which offers a unified API to interact with all
different types of sensors and actuators on RIOT supported hardware. Furthermore, it re-enables
the support for ICN by integrating CCN-Lite as a package. A lot of new overall documentation was
added and existing documentation was improved (http://riot-os.org/api/). In addition,
a Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration file was added to the RIOT repository in
order to create reproducible and portable environments that contain all necessary toolchains.

About 222 pull requests with about 631 commits have been merged since the last release and 48
additional issues have been solved. 37 people contributed code in 102 days. 980 files have been
touched with ~59779 insertions and ~12115 deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================

#2724: Add support for serial number passing to CMSIS boards, document it
    Documentation about how to discover and set the serial number of CMSIS-DAP chips is missing
#3201: Odd length packet snips cause invalid check sum
    If an odd length packet snip occurs in a packet and is not the last snip
    (in the order the packet is supposed to be, not in the list's order)
    in a packet it will generate a wrong check sum.

Known Issues
============

network related issues
----------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision
    NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing
    to lower precision would save some memory.
#3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
    The size of the link-layer header is not dynamically calculated, but instead the maximum
    size is always assumed.
#3970: RPL: Advertise DODAG only over the assigned interface
     gnrc_rpl seems to multicast DIOs over all interfaces, though gnrc_rpl_init expects an
     interface as parameter and sets the RPL-nodes multicast address only for that interface.
#4048: potential racey memory leak
     According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a
     memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a
     completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#4462: IPHC/NHC broken between Linux and a RIOT node with a RIOT-based border router in between.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#3341 and #3824: nativenet crashes when hammered
    Flood-pinging a native instance from more than one host (either multiple threads on the
    host system or multiple other native instances), leads to a SEGFAULT.
#4608: tests/xtimer_usleep_until: unstable behaviour
    The test starts to output "too large difference" and fails after a random period of time.

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc
    oonf_api is not building with clang.
#4583: cpp11: clang doesn't allow `mutex_t` to be used with `constexpr`
    All cpp11-* tests fail with clang.

other issues
------------
#2761: core: define default flags
    If a thread is created without the corresponding flag  (CREATE_STACKTEST),
    the ps command will yield wrong numbers for the stack usage
#2927: core: Automatically select the lowest possible LPM mode
    Not all available low power modes (LPMs) are implemented for each platform and the
    concept of how the LPM is chosen needs some reconsideration
#2967: Makefile.features: location is not relevant for all features
    Provided features for the build system should be split up into a board and cpu specific
    part
#3109: periph/random: random_read should return unsigned int
    The documentation of this function does not match corresponding implementation.
#4488: Making the newlib thread-safe
    When calling puts/printf after thread_create(), the CPU hangs for DMA enabled uart drivers.

    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.
#1577: ccn-lite: populate does not work with disabled cache
    If cache is set to zero, the chunks cannot be loaded and therefore also not get populated.
#1870: IPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed
    According to Wireshark, ICMPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed (wrong
    checksum or other reasons).

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.


other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.
#1442: setting channel is not persistent cc2420
    After changing the channel via a shell command, the channel reverts back to an arbitrary
    value. However, this might be only a shell problem.
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20"
    dependent on the platform, vtimer stops working after some time.
#1891: printf formatting does not work properly on some Cortex platforms for 64 bit numbers
    This problem happens mostly for the Newlib nano, which does not support 64 bit integer
    printing, but sometimes happens also with other toolchains.
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    The shell is sometimes not properly working after a reboot and the PDR is sometimes
    worse than expected.
#2143: tests.core doesn't compile for all platforms
    For some missing GCC compiler builtins, the unittests do not compile for MSP430
    platforms.
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The application examples/default for example will crash when issuing the txtsnd command

other issues:
--------------
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    The timer callback might still fire even after vtimer_remove() was called.
#2175: valgrind registeres "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests for ubjson
     According to valgrind the stack gets corrupted in UBJSON.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#45: bit field order in the fcf may be wrong
    The CC2420 FIFO expects the IEEE802.15.4 FCF field in reversed bit order.
    With this release the byte order is now handled by the net_if module and
    all device specific handling is done by the driver.
#82: Setting STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED thread to STATUS_PENDING though it is not
     handled yet
    In some rare cases the status of a thread might falsely change to
    STATUS_PENDING instead of STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED.
#455: sha256 is broken on MSP430
    Fixed.
#498: native is segfaulting at startup
    Fixed by several PRs (#501, #583, and #588).
#505: native on FreeBSD is broken
    Fixed by PR #1022.

Known Issues
============
network related issues
----------------------
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.
#1127: Random build fails on OSX
    Building for native on OSX often fails - Workaround: build using  -B  flag,
    e.g.:  make -B clean all

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#426: Interrupt handling on MSP430 is buggy
    UART and timer handling is currently unstable on MSP430 based platforms
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.

RIOT-2014.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: from 16-bit
microcontrollers to light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).
