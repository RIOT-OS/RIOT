RIOT-2017.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time capabilities and comes with
support for a range of devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit microcontrollers,
16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft real-time capabilities,
small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access, independent of the underlying hardware
(with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is independent of specific vendors
(e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1),
which allows indirect business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features, fixes and enhancements. Among others these features
contain an initial - still experimental - TCP implementation based on the GNRC network stack, support
for reading from and writing to SD cards, a new power management architecture as well additional third
party packages such as TweetNaCl, a cryptographic library, and Heatshrink a data compression library
optimized for embedded real-time systems.
We added support for new platforms including the Calliope mini, Maple mini, and a couple of STMs
Nucleo boards. Device support was extended by several new drivers, e.g., for NXP PN532 NFC, Microchip
MRF24J40 802.15.4 radio (experimental), or Bosch BME280 pressure/humidity/temperature sensor.
We completely refactored the SPI interface, allowing for internally handled hardware or software chip
select lines and shared bus usage for multiple devices with different SPI configurations.

About 278 pull requests with about 606 commits have been merged since the last release and about 84
issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code in 87 days. 2230 files have been touched with
220275 insertions and 159840 deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#4388: POSIX sockets: open socket is bound to a specific thread
#4737: cortex-m: Hard fault after a thread exits
#4874: Using single RSSI_BASE_VALUE for all Atmel radios
#5034: gnrc_networking: offers txtsnd, does not print received packets
#5083: AVR8: Reboots after `return 0;`
#5719: cc2538: rf driver doesn't handle large packets
#5954: nRF52 uart_write gets stuck
#6036: tinydtls: DTLS randomly missing functions
#6037: pkg/nanocoap: native build fails on macOS
#6358: arduino uno : xtimer accuracy problem

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision
       which is not required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#4048: potential racey memory leak: According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast
       destination may lead to a memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare
       case and a completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some operations mutexes to the
       network interfaces need to get unlocked in the current implementation to not get deadlocked.
       Recursive mutexes as provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of size ~512 B might lead
       to crashes. The issue describes this for several hundret nodes, but agressive flooding with
       just two nodes was also shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame gets lost the reassembly
       state machine might get out of sync
#6123: gnrc: crash with (excessive) traffic

NDP is not working properly
---------------------------
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router solicitation might lead
       to invalid zero-length link-layer addresses in neighbor cache.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address: Under some  circumstances a router might
       send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored on receive (as RFC-4861 specifies), RAs should have
       link-local addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while: Several issues
       (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address effectively being banned from the network
       (disappears from neighbor cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by outdated ncache at router
#5539: Border Router: packet not forwarded from ethos to interface 6
#5790: ND: Lost of Global IPV6 on node after sending lot of UDP frame from BR

Timer related issues
--------------------
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list: Under some conditions an xtimer can end up twice in the
       internal list of the xtimer module
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe for non-32-bit platforms.
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in there board_init()
       function. The xtimer is however first initialized in the auto_init module which is executed
       after board_init()
#6052: tests: xtimer_drift gets stuck: xtimer_drift application freezes after ~30-200 seconds
#6331: RTC alarm triggered with 1s delay
#6419: cpu/cc2538: timer broken
#6427: xtimer: infinite loop with xtimer_mutex_lock_timeout
#6502: cpu/stm32l1: RTC broken
#6542: boards/nucle-f0xx: misconfigured timer configuration (fix in #6494)

native related issues
---------------------
#495:  native not float safe: When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either
       the stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#2175: ubjson: valgind registers "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#5796: native: tlsf: early malloc will lead to a crash: TLSF needs pools to be initialized (which is
       currently expected to be done in an application). If a malloc is needed before an application's
       main started (e.g. driver initialization) the node can crash, since no pool is allocated yet.
#6145: native: system reboots on SIGTRAP
#6442: cpu/native: timer interrupt does not yield thread

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1891: newlib-nano: Printf formatting does not work properly for some numeric types: PRI[uxdi]64,
       PRI[uxdi]8 and float are not parsed in newlib-nano
#2006: cpu/nrf51822: timer callback may be fired too early
#2143: unittests: tests-core doesn't compile for all platforms: GCC build-ins were used in the
       unittests which are not available with msp430-gcc
#2300: qemu unittest fails because of a page fault
#4512: pkg: tests: RELIC unittests fail on iotlab-m3
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc oonf_api is not building with clang (partly fixed by #4593)
#4694: drivers/lm75a: does not build
#4822: kw2xrf: packet loss when packets get fragmented
#4876: at86rf2xx: Simultaneous use of different transceiver types is not supported
#4954: chronos: compiling with -O0 breaks
#4866: not all GPIO driver implementations are thread safe: Due to non-atomic operations in the drivers
       some pin configurations might get lost.
#5009: RIOT is saw-toothing in energy consumption (even when idling)
#5103: xtimer: weird behavior of tests/xtimer_drift: xtimer_drift randomly jumps a few seconds on nrf52
#5361: cpu/cc26x0: timer broken
#5405: Eratic timings on iotlab-m3 with compression context activated
#5460: cpu/samd21: i2c timing with compiler optimization

       for DMA enabled uart drivers.
#4866: periph: GPIO drivers are not thread safe
#5128: make: buildtest breaks when exporting FEATURES_PROVIDED var

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features as well as it  fixes several major
bugs. Among these new features are the new simplified network socket API
called sock, the GNRC specific CoAP implementation gcoap and several new
packages: TinyDTLS, the Aversive++ microcontroller library for robotics, the
u8g2 graphic library, and nanocoap.
Using the new sock API an implementation of the Simple Time Network Protocol
(SNTP) was also introduced, allowing for time synchronization between nodes.
New platforms include the Arduino Uno, the Arduino Duemilanove, the Arduino
Zero, SODAQ Autonomo, and the Zolertia remote (rev. B).
The most significant bug fix was done in native which led to a significantly
more robust handling of ISRs and now allows for at least 1,000 native
instances running stably on one machine.

About 263 pull requests with about 398 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 42 issues have been solved. 37 people contributed with code
in 100 days. 1006 files have been touched with 166500 insertions and 26926
deletions.

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community)
and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release was focused primarily on fixing bugs, but also adds two new 
supported radio transceivers: CC2420 and CC2538.
This new radio support allows to new interoperability tests with other OS, 
allowing code size comparison and overall network performance for 
platforms based on these radios.

About 198 pull requests with about 325 commits have been merged since the
last release and about 65 issues have been solved. 46 people contributed with 
code in 112 days. 632 files have been touched with 19863 insertions and 
3682 deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#3824: native: gnrc: hardcore pinging crashes.
#4583: cpp11: clang doesn't allow mutex_t to be used with constexpr All 
cpp11-* tests fail with clang.
#5388: gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc_nhc: receiving NHC compressed UDP 
packets hits assert in IPv6 (Fixed by #5281).


Known Issues
==========
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision NHDP works with timer
 values of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing to lower 
 precision would save some memory.
#3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
#4048: potential racey memory leak According to the packet buffer stats, 
flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a memory leak due to a 
race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a completely filled 
up packet buffer was not observed.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address Under some 
circumstances a router might send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored 
on receive (as RFC 4861 specifies), RAs should have link-local addresses 
 and not even be send out this way.
#5007: gnrc icmpv6: Ping reply goes out the wrong interface
#5055: cpuid: multiple radios will get same EUI-64 Nodes with multiple 
interfaces might get the same EUI-64 for them since they are generated from
 the same CPU ID.
 #5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers. 
(Fix exists, but was postponed)
#5390: pkg: OpenWSN does not compile This package still uses deprecated 
modules and was not tested for a long time.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe When the FPU is used when an asynchronous 
context switch occurs, either the stack gets corrupted or a floating point 
exception occurs.
#534: native debugging on osx fails Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet 
target in OSX leads to "the network" being stuck (gdb) or the whole process 
being stuck (valgrind).
#334: nativenet crashes when hammered Flood-pinging a native instance 
from more than one host (either multiple threads on the host system or multiple 
other native instances), leads to a SEGFAULT.
#2071; WIP: native: overdue fixes
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#5432: native: valgrind fails

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc oonf_api is not building with 
clang. 
(Partly solved by #4593)
#4866: not all GPIO driver implementations are thread safe Due to non-atomic
 operations in the drivers some pin configurations might get lost.
 #5486: at86rf2xx: lost interrupts

other issues
------------
#1263: TLSF implementation contains (a) read-before-write error(s).
#2761: core: define default flags If a thread is created without the 
corresponding flag (CREATE_STACKTEST), the ps command will yield wrong 
numbers for the stack usage.
#2927: core: Automatically select the lowest possible LPM mode Not all 
available low power modes (LPMs) are implemented for each platform and the 
concept of how the LPM is chosen needs some reconsideration.
#2967: Makefile.features: location is not relevant for all features Provided 
features for the build system should be split up into a board and cpu specific part
#4488: Making the newlib thread-safe When calling puts/printf after 
thread_create(), the CPU hangs for DMA enabled uart drivers.
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list Under some conditions an xtimer can end
 up twice in the internal list of the xtimer module.
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe For non-32-bit platforms.

RIOT-2016.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community)
and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release adds support for two additional network stacks: lwIP and emb6.
A bunch of additional protocols are now available, P2P-RPL in the GNRC
network stack, Ethernet-over-Serial (ethos). Murdock, the new, blazing fast
RIOT CI is now available to significantly speed up code merging procedures.

This release also adds support for a number of new boards and sensors and a new
tool for automated border router setup is now provided which greatly simplifies
that setup for newbies as well as for old-timers. Last but not least: this
release includes a number of bug fixes, mostly about stabilizing and enhancing
the networking capabilities of RIOT.

About 470 pull requests with about 1196 commits have been merged since the last
release and 127 additional issues have been solved. 55 people contributed code
in 124 days. 1521 files have been touched with ~91700 insertions and ~42200
deletions.

RIOT-2015.12 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).

About this release:
===================
This release is mostly a clean-up and bug-fixing release. Besides that, it introduces SAUL,
the [S]ensor [A]ctuator [U]ber [L]ayer, which offers a unified API to interact with all
different types of sensors and actuators on RIOT supported hardware. Furthermore, it re-enables
the support for ICN by integrating CCN-Lite as a package. A lot of new overall documentation was
added and existing documentation was improved (http://riot-os.org/api/). In addition,
a Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration file was added to the RIOT repository in
order to create reproducible and portable environments that contain all necessary toolchains.

About 222 pull requests with about 631 commits have been merged since the last release and 48
additional issues have been solved. 37 people contributed code in 102 days. 980 files have been
touched with ~59779 insertions and ~12115 deletions.

    host system or multiple other native instances), leads to a SEGFAULT.
#4608: tests/xtimer_usleep_until: unstable behaviour
    The test starts to output "too large difference" and fails after a random period of time.

Selected Issues Fixed since the Last Release
============================================
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    A completely new border router implementation is in place
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    Fixed by @benoit-canet in #2870
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    GNRC implements 6LoWPAN ND in a RFC6775 compliant way
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20" and
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    vtimer has been replaced by xtimer which does not have these issues
#1870: IPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed
    According to Wireshark (and reference implementations) GNRC sends
    well-formed neighbor advertisements
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    Solved by new driver versions for UART and radio
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The stacksize has been adapted in #2229

Known Issues
============

network related issues
----------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision
    NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision which is not
    required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
    The size of the link-layer header is not dynamically calculated, but
    instead the maximum# size is always assumed.
#3201: Odd length packet snips cause invalid check sum
    If an odd length packet snip occurs in a packet and is not the last snip
    (in the order the packet is supposed to be, not in the list's order) in  a
    packet it will generate a wrong check sum.
#4048: potential racey memory leak
    According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast destination
    may lead to a memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be
    a rare case and a completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#3341 and #3824: nativenet crashes when hammered
    Flood-pinging a native instance from more than one host (either multiple
    threads on the host system or multiple other native instances), leads to a
    SEGFAULT.

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#2724: Add support for serial number passing to CMSIS boards, document it
    Documentation about how to discover and set the serial number of CMSIS-DAP
    chips is missing

other issues
------------
#2761: core: define default flags
     If a thread is created without the corresponding flag  (CREATE_STACKTEST),
     the ps command will yield wrong numbers for the  stack usage
#2927: core: Automatically select the lowest possible LPM mode
    Not all available low power modes (LPMs) are implemented for each platform
    and the concept of how the LPM is chosen need some reconsideration
#2967: Makefile.features: location is not relevant for all features
    Provided features for the build system should be split up into a board and
    cpu specific part
#3109: periph/random: random_read should return unsigned int
    The documentation of this function does not match corresponding
    implementation.

network related issues
----------------------
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.
#1577: ccn-lite: populate does not work with disabled cache
    If cache is set to zero, the chunks cannot be loaded and therefore also not get populated.
#1870: IPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed
    According to Wireshark, ICMPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed (wrong
    checksum or other reasons).

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.


other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.
#1442: setting channel is not persistent cc2420
    After changing the channel via a shell command, the channel reverts back to an arbitrary
    value. However, this might be only a shell problem.
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20"
    dependent on the platform, vtimer stops working after some time.
#1891: printf formatting does not work properly on some Cortex platforms for 64 bit numbers
    This problem happens mostly for the Newlib nano, which does not support 64 bit integer
    printing, but sometimes happens also with other toolchains.
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    The shell is sometimes not properly working after a reboot and the PDR is sometimes
    worse than expected.
#2143: tests.core doesn't compile for all platforms
    For some missing GCC compiler builtins, the unittests do not compile for MSP430
    platforms.
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The application examples/default for example will crash when issuing the txtsnd command

other issues:
--------------
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    The timer callback might still fire even after vtimer_remove() was called.
#2175: valgrind registeres "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests for ubjson
