RIOT-2024.10 "FlexTape" - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

Highlights of the 2024.10 release:

This release fixes some long-standing packet buffer leaks that occurred when using
`gnrc_netif_pktq` and 6LoWPAN or `netdev_new_api` (#20983, #20834).

A long standing-bug in the CC2538 radio driver has been fixed when processing
corrupted frames, that before could render the device unresponsive. This can be
triggered due to radio interference, but we also believe that an attacker within range
of the radio could send crafted frames to reliably trigger the issue. We therefore
consider this a denial of service vulnerability and advise all users of the CC2538 to
upgrade to 2024.10 or cherry-pick 1b61216da734fcd40ae0d832b800e4e67975bdc8. More
details are published in the [security advisory](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-m75q-8vj8-wppw).

With SUIT it is now easier to accept firmwares signed with different keys,
e.g., a node build and signed with a development key can be configured to
accept images signed with either the development key or the production key (#21019).
The public keys are now also stored on the developer's machine, so if a
encrypted private key is used, you don't need the decryption password to build
a firmware, only for signing it (#20862).

`THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST` is now the default when `DEVELHELP` is used.

This release saw the addition of the `adafruit-metro-m4-express` board.

129 pull requests, composed of 255 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 5 issues have been solved. 29 people contributed with
code in 119 days. 502 files have been touched with 142126 (+) insertions and

RIOT-2024.07 "StrikinglyCrowded" - Release Notes
================================================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2024.07 release, nicknamed "StrikinglyCrowded", includes many features and bug fixes.
Here are some of the highlights:

+ RIOT now boots on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (#20668)
+ To support boards with Ethernet plugs such as the Adafruit Ethernet FeatherWing, RIOT now ships a driver for the W5500 ethernet chip (#20301)
+ RIOT now leverages the ARMv8-M hardware support to enforce the stack size (#20633)
+ The PSA Crypto API implementation in RIOT now supports persistent key storage and additional hashing algorithms (#20099, #20598, #20698)
+ This release features several useful additions to the RIOT CoAP stacks: a coaps forward proxy for gcoap, delayed responses for nanocoap_sock, and the ability to mount a remote filesystem over CoAP (#20454, #20266, #20687)
* Support of the 16-bit MSP430 MCU has been improving over the last few releases, with the addition of power management in this release as an example (#20613)
* First steps towards enabling RIOT support of new Microchip SAM MCUs (#20708, #20710, #20713, #20714)
* Compiling with `BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1` will now by default use the exact container version the code was tested in the CI, fetching it from upstream if not locally present. (#20472)

RIOT-2024.04 "UwUtastic" - Release Notes
========================================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2024.04 release, nicknamed "UwUtastic", includes many features and bug fixes.
Here are some of the highlights:

+ RIOT boots on two newly added boards:
    + The Nintendo Game Boy Advance (#19519)
    + Native on 64-bit Linux / x86_64 (#20315, #20335, #20339)
+ The documentation features a new guide to help you set up a RIOT development environment on Windows (#20426)
+ To accommodate the ever growing RAM sizes in the IoT, RIOT can now monitor your `malloc` usage (#20363)
- Dependency modelling via Kconfig is no longer part of RIOT. A big step forward towards having only one source of truth for configurations (#20438)


210 pull requests, composed of 446 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 4 issues have been solved. 42 people contributed with
code in 82 days. 2409 files have been touched with 26218 (+) insertions and

RIOT-2024.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2024.01 release includes:

- Breaking change for board definition due to XFA for pointers to defined MTD.
  This means users will need to:
    - remove the `MTD_NUMOF` definition from `board.h`
    - add `MTD_XFA_ADD(<mtd_dev>, <idx>);` to the definition of `<mtd_dev>`.
    - `MTD_0`, `MTD_1`, … defines are no longer needed. Use `mtd_dev_get(0)`,
      `mtd_dev_get(1)`, … instead.
- Many fixes to peripherals due to the periph testing shield
- The AVR-8 now has power management
- The ESP32 family is now supported by the SDMMC peripheral driver
- `native` now is supported in pyterm
- `tests/periph/uart_locate_pins` helps discover which pins are where
- the `periph_timer` API supports `periph_timer_query_freqs`
- The GNRC boarder router application supports ZEP topology
- Removal of Kconfig dependency modelling (but still configurations supported)

194 pull requests, composed of 475 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 4 issues have been solved. 30 people contributed with
code in 64 days. 1083 files have been touched with 36196 (+) insertions and

RIOT-2023.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

RIOT-2023.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

This release sees the addition of the openDSME IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.
So far it is limited to 2.4 GHz O-QPSK and drivers that have been converted
to the new sub-MAC architecture yet.

We also have two new supported MCUs: nRF53 and ATmega8. They share common
peripherals with their siblings, for nRF53 only the application core is
supported so far.

Finally, all tests live in subdirectories now, so the tests/ directory is much
more orderly.

288 pull requests, composed of 661 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 35 issues have been solved. 26 people contributed with
code in 96 days. 6844 files have been touched with 251875 (+) insertions and
224148 deletions (-).

RIOT-2023.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

RIOT-2023.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

We are proud to announce the release of RIOT 2023.01, marking the tenth
anniversary of the project. Over the past decade, RIOT has become a thriving
open-source community, delivering cutting-edge technology for Internet of
Things (IoT) devices. This release builds on top of the hard work and
dedication of our developers, users, and contributors, and we would like to
extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey.
Here's to another decade of innovation and growth!

Noteworthy changes the 2023.01 release includes, among many fixes and little
things:

- ztimer_ondemand: The next step towards seamless and automatic power management.
- The Rust examples now default to stable Rust.

187 pull requests, composed of 570 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 13 issues have been solved. 37 people contributed with
code in 58 days. 1248 files have been touched with 516544 (+) insertions and
12047 deletions (-).

RIOT-2022.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2022.10 release includes, among many many bug fixes and improvements, the
following prominent contributions:

### Security Fixes

The GNRC network stack has received a number of security fixes. All users of
GNRC are advised to update to the new release. Given that no user facing
breaking API changes are included, we are hopeful that the update is painless
and quickly possible.

### ESP32 family

RIOT has been ported to the ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2, and the ESP32-S3 MCUs. In
addition driver support for the integrated BLE transceiver of the ESP32 MCUs
has been added.

### Major CI Upgrade

While the CI is developed in an independent repository, it is still a noteworthy
change that our CI software, Murdock, was updated since the last release. In
addition to changes under the hood the web front end got a major revamp. You
will directly notice the improvements in page load time and clarity/structure of
the interface. If you haven't already, please check out https://ci.riot-os.org
to take a look.

### Support for Priority Inheritance in `core_mutex`

If a shared resource guarded by a mutex is used by a high priority and a low
priority thread, the high priority thread may end up waiting on the low priority
thread to return the resource. If medium priority threads now interrupt the
low priority thread while working with the shared resource, the high priority
thread ends up waiting on both medium and low priority threads. This effect is
called priority inversion.

Priority inversion can in most cases be solved by carefully assigning priorities
and resources. In some cases however, this cannot be avoided: Let's consider
a scenario in which an I2C temperature sensor and an I2C IMU are used. Since
temperature changes are slow in frequency, the temperature readings are
assigned the lowest priority, while the IMU readings are assigned the highest
priority. The sensible approach here is to have both sensors on distinct I2C
buses. However, if e.g. only a single I2C bus is available by the hardware
priority inversion cannot be prevented by careful resource and priority
assignment alone. In these cases the module `core_mutex_priority_inheritance`
can be used to lend the low priority thread the priority of the high priority
thread while the high priority thread is waiting for the mutex hold by the
low priority thread.

After RIOT has already [been launched into space](https://github.com/thingsat)
it is now ready to for
[Mars](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/teach/comp790/papers/mars_pathfinder_long_version.html).

### USB Support for STM32F1 MCUs

While RIOT has longstanding USB support for many STM32 MCU families, the F1
family was not supported due to some peculiarities in the memory layout. The
driver has now been extended to handle them correctly. With this, the popular
STM32F103 bluepill board now supports stdio via USB, which however still
has to be manually enabled e.g. by:

```sh
USEMODULE=stdio_cdc_acm BOARD=bluepill make -C examples/default
```

### Support for podman

Just add an `export DOCKER=podman` to your `~/.profile` (or `~/.bashrc`, or ...)
and an `make BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1` will use [podman](https://podman.io/) instead of
docker to run the RIOT build container. Two major advantages of using `podman`
over `docker` is the support of rootless containers and not depending on a
central background daemon.

### Support for Sharing nRF52 combined I2C/SPI Peripherals

The nRF52 MCUs have a limited number of combined I2C/SPI peripherals.
Previously, each such peripheral could either provide a single I2C or a
single SPI bus. A board configuration that used the same combined peripheral
to provide both an SPI and an I2C bus previously resulted in bad surprises at
run-time.

The I2C/SPI drivers have now been reworked so that they can be shared in
round-robin fashion between multiple I2C and SPI buses. This is especially
useful for the upcoming support of the Bangle.js 2 watch that uses more I2C
buses than combined I2C/SPI peripherals available on the used nRF52840 MCU.
Thanks to the sharing of peripherals, all I2C buses can now be provided by a
single peripheral.

### Support for GCC 12.2.0

Many fixes for compilation and runtime issues that only started to surface
with GCC 12.2.0 have been fixed. This allows our users to confidentially choose
the current release with little to no fear that toolchain updates in the near
future will break the precious projects. In addition, we hope that the next
CI update will also cause less friction.

API Changes
-----------

+ drivers/kw2xrf: add support for IEEE 802.15.4 Radio HAL (#18383)
    - Applications using the proper network stack APIs (such as the SOCK API or
      POSIX sockets) will not notice any chances, except for e.g. the better
      packet reception rate
+ sys/shell: make cmds submodules and add KConfig modeling (#18355)
    - Shell commands can now be individually selected by using the corresponding
      `shell_cmd_<name>` module. What previously was called `shell_commands` now
      is `shell_cmds_default` and will automagically select shell commands based
      on the set of modules used. Users can keep using `shell_commands` for now,
      but the build system will inform them that `shell_commands` is deprecated.
* cpu/sam0_common: adc: drop pin from adc_conf_chan_t (#18658)
    - Application developers will not have to change their code. However, out of
      tree SAM0 boards that contain an ADC configuration will need to remove the
      `.pin` member and rename the existing `.muxpos` member to `.inputctrl`
* hashes_cmac: rename to hashes_aes128_cmac (#18539)
    - Existing C call sides will continue to work due to compatibility wrappers.
      However, applications should migrate before the deprecated wrappers are
      dropped.
* nanocoap_sock: constify remote (#18588)
    - This will  not break any existing C call sides
* gnrc_netreg: Use locks around netreg (#18740)
    - calls to `gnrc_netreg_lookup()` and `gnrc_netreg_getnext()` now need to be
      guarded
* sys/hash/pbkdf2: Accept passwd as `void *` instead of `uint8_t *` (#18941)
    - This is not breaking any existing C call sides, but new code no longer
      needs to cast `char *` to `uint8_t *`

Uncategorized
-------------
+ .murdock.yml: add footer comment about production stage (#18667)
+ .murdock.yml: add new Murdock configuration (#18084)
+ pkg/lwip: add missing initialization for async_cb (#18693)
* bootloader/riotboot_dfu: move ztimer_init() prior to usbus start (#18538)
* murdock: fix bors branch name (testing -> trying) (#18665)
* Release notes 2022.07 (#18512)

And 40 minor changes.

Deprecations
============

- The module `shell_commands` is now deprecated. User should use
  `shell_cmds_default`. For now, `shell_commands` is an alias of
  `shell_cmds_default`
- Shell commands that were individually selectable even before this release were
  renamed to match the pattern `shell_cmd_<name>`, while they previously where
  often called `<name>_cmd`. The previous names are aliases of the new names
  and the build system will list any deprecated modules used.
- Users of `hashes_cmac` should update to `hashes_aes128_cmac` before the legacy
  wrappers now in place for backward compatibility will be removed.

RIOT-2022.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2022.07 release includes many changes, some highlights of which are:

### GPIO Low-level drivers

A new API, `gpio_ll`, has been introduced for highly efficient access to GPIO
pins grouped in ports.

The API is limited to internal use for the time being, but still paves the way
towards using port multipliers like local GPIO pins, and for improved
bit-banging implementations (e.g. around WS281x-style LEDs).

### Improved serial port selection

When using multiple boards simultaneously, a new serial port selection
algorithm can be activated by setting `MOST_RECENT_PORT=1`. Of all serial ports
whose metadata matches the board's known properties, it selects the most
recently connected one.

### ESP support

The ESP IDF (IoT Development Framework; the vendor's provided tools) has been
upgraded to version 4.4, and many peripheral drivers are now implemented using those.


343 pull requests, composed of 767 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 5 issues have been solved. 38 people contributed with
code in 107 days. 1684 files have been touched with 43451 (+) insertions and
82174 deletions (-).

RIOT-2022.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2022.04 release includes the following new features and improvements:

Core:
-----
The scheduler allows for changing the priority of a thread at runtime.

System libraries:
-----------------
The module `ztimer64_xtimer_compat` was added, providing the complete xtimer
API on top of ztimer64_usec. This is now the default implementation when using
the `xtimer` module.
Most modules use ztimer instead of xtimer now.

The sequence of modules during auto initialization can be customized via
statically assigned numbers now. This feature is experimental, so use it with
caution. Priorities may change in the future.

SenML implementation: supports CBOR encoding, Phydat to SenML encoding and
basic SAUL integration.

Various improvements have been made to the file system modules:
VFS supports automatic mount (and formatting) at startup and reliable disk
enumeration, and mount_by_path. Default mount points can be provided by the
board configuration. exFAT support was added to FATFS.

Using Rust in RIOT no longer requires a nightly version of Rust, but can be
built on the latest stable on Rust instead.

Boards:
-------
Boards no longer have to provide a `board_init()` function. LEDs are
initialized automatically if they follow the `LED<x>_PIN` naming scheme.

Networking:
-----------
gcoap now provides a simple forward-proxy and allows for switching between
plain CoAP and CoAP-over-DTLS at runtime.

The NimBLE module supports the new PHY modes that have been introduced with
Bluetooth 5.

A Telnet server module is available now.

Packages:
---------
The build system now allows for package directories to reside outside the RIOT
tree.

Various new packages have been added:
 * the C++ Embedded Template Library (ETL)
 * nanors, a tiny, performant implementation of reed solomon codes
 * tflite-micro as a replacement for tensorflow-lite
 * WAMR adds Web assembly (WASM) support

Hardware support:
-----------------
New support for the boards Adafruit-PyBadge and STM32 Nucleo-F439ZI as well as
for the LPS22CH nano pressure sensor and MCP47xx DAC. The DOSE bus now supports
baud rates of 1 MHz and above.


Summary:
-------
328 pull requests, composed of 810 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 6 issues have been solved. 40 people contributed with
code in 83 days. 1851 files have been touched with 50235 (+) insertions and

RIOT-2022.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2022.01 release brings support for new packages, new boards and drivers,
as well as several package upgrades and bug fixes. Among others, this release
improves the RIOT codebase with:

Rust support
------------

RIOT now offers convenient integration of Rust application programming, with
wrappers interfacing to RIOT modules such as timers, network stack.


Improved timers
---------------

Many modules have migrated from using xtimer to our more power-efficient
alternative ztimer. Also, ztimer64 was introduced, which enables
a drop-in replacement for all of xtimer features.


Kconfig support
---------------

Kconfig modeling coverage is significantly extended. Nearly all supported
boards are now modeled with Kconfig.


Summary:
--------

436 pull requests, composed of 1159 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 11 issues have been solved. 43 people contributed with
code in 88 days. 2475 files have been touched with 44925 (+) insertions and
14687 deletions (-).

RIOT-2021.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release
==================

The 2021.10 release includes:

The last three months again brought many new features, fixes and improvements
to the RIOT codebase. There is new hardware support, new helper functions and
many new modules that help with building IoT applications.

Some of the new features are:

GCOAP DTLS
----------

The GCOAP CoAP library now supports transport encryption via tinyDTLS.
This is a compile-time toggle, so either all requests are encrypted or none.
There is already a PR (#16688) that will allow to mix encrypted and unencrypted
requests.

FIDO2 support
-------------

We now have an implementation of the Fast Identity Online 2 (FIDO2) specification.
With this you can use any RIOT device with USB support as an authentication token
similar to the YubiKey.

RPL-over-BLE
------------

The 6LoWPAN over Bluetooth Low Energy module has gained support for the RPL
routing protocol. With this it's now possible to set up IPv6 based mesh networks
over BLE on chips supported by the Nimble Bluetooth stack.

GNRC TCP
--------

RIOT's native GNRC network stack now has support for the TCP protocol via the
socket API. With this you can switch between LWIP and GNRC without changing your
application.

DHCPv6 relay agent
------------------

The DHCP module can now act as a relay, forwarding DHCPv6 requests for
multihop-operation.

DHCPv6 IA_NA support
--------------------

The DHCPv6 client can now also request non-temporary addresses as an alternative
to Stateless Access Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) that is used by default.
The feature can be enabled by selecting the `dhcpv6_client_ia_na` module.

gnrc_ipv6_auto_subnets
----------------------

This new module allows to split a large IPv6 prefix into smaller ones that can
be used to configure downstream interfaces with a prefix.
The process can be repeated recursively for a cascading subnet topology.

This can be a lightweight alternative to DHCPv6 that only relies on router
advertisements.

For more details on this, see the talk on the 2021 RIOT summit.

UDP benchmark
-------------

The examples section has gained a UDP benchmark.
This can be used as a network stress test and is accompanied by a host tool
(`dist/tools/benchmark_udp`) that acts as the benchmark server to which the
benchmark clients will connect.

URI template processor
----------------------

URI templates up to level 3 (according to RFC 6570) can now be parsed with this
tool.

riotboot serial flasher
-----------------------

RIOT's native bootloader has gained the ability to load a firmware via UART.
This allows to program a board without the need for external programmers, a
serial console is enough.

RTC mem for sam0 and STM32
--------------------------

Many real-time clocks have the ability to store a few bytes in their memory as
user data. This memory is retained across reboots and deep sleep.

We now have an interface for this feature and implemented it on SAM L21,
SAM D5x/E5x and STM32.

LWIP improvements
-----------------

The alternative LWIP network stack can now make use of multiple interfaces.
Initialisation is done using the new XFA (cross-file array) feature so new
drivers can be added by only adding a single file.

Advanced topologies in ZEP dispatcher
-------------------------------------

With `socket_zep` and the ZEP dispatcher it is possible to simulate a virtual
IEEE 802.15.4 network with `native` nodes.
ZEP dispatcher has now gained support for lossy connections that make this
simulation behave closer to reality.

There are also PRs pending to automatically generate such topologies (#16889)
and to hook up the ZEP dispatcher to the foren6 network visualizer (#16879).

RIOT_VERSION_CODE macro
-----------------------

We have added a `RIOT_VERSION_CODE` macro that can be used by external
modules / boards to check against which RIOT version it is compiled.

This allows to react to API changes if the module is built against different
versions of RIOT.

gnrc_netif_ipv6_wait_for_global_address()
-----------------------------------------

For apps that want to connect to a remote server, send some data and then go back
to sleep, there is now the new `gnrc_netif_ipv6_wait_for_global_address()` function.

This function blocks until a global address has been configured (e.g. via router
advertisement) or a timeout happens.
So no more guessing if a connection can yet be established or if the interface is
not configured yet.

This feature depends on the `gnrc_netif_bus` module.

netutils_get_ipv6()
-------------------

This simple function can parse a IPv6 address from a string.
But that's not all - if the `sock_dns` module is enabled, the string can also
be a hostname which will then be resolved.

This provides a small and simple alternative to `getaddrinfo()` that can be used
by shell commands and applications alike.

gnrc_icmpv6_echo corruption detection
-------------------------------------

On Linux the `ping` command from iputils has the neat feature that it fills the
payload with of the ICMP echo request with a pattern that is then echoed back by
the receiver.

That means it can detect if the payload got corruped on the way, e.g. by broken
fragmentation or other errors.

The RIOT `ping` command now also implements this feature that lets you easily
detect if something broke along the way.

New Hardware Support
--------------------

In this cycle we have seen the addition of three new MCU families!
Our latest additions are the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and the GD32VF103 RISC-V MCU
from GigaDevice.

Both only have very basic support so far (only GPIO, UART and timers), which
still leaves many low hanging fruits for adding peripheral drivers.
Patches welcome!

The nRF9160 is closer to it's nRF52 siblings, but brings GPS and LTE-M/NB-IoT
peripherals. While we are not there yet, there is ongoing work to also support
these in RIOT.

The ATxmega family of 8-bit MCUs can now make use of the EBI interface to use
external memory. The new XMEGA-A1 Xplained already makes use of this feature.

On the STM32 side we have now support for the `nucleo-wl55jc` and it's LoRa
transceiver.
The IEEE 802.15.4 / BLE radio on the STM32WB family is however still waiting
for a driver.

The common LM75 family of temperature drivers is now supported by RIOT.

The ethernet driver for the SAM E5x line of MCUs is now stable.

The sub-MAC layer that implements common MAC features for IEEE 802.15.4 radios
has again seen many improvements.
It is currently used by the nRF52 and CC2538 line of MCUs.

API changes
-----------

The `spi_acquire()` no longer returns an error code but will throw an assertion
if called with the wrong parameters.
This allows to speed up SPI operations a bit as SPI parameters are usually fixed
at compile time.

The `gnrc_netdev_default` was replaced by the network stack agnostic
`netdev_default` module.

For now `gnrc_netdev_default` remains an alias for `netdev_default`, but it will
be removed in a future release.

RIOT-2021.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

RIOT-2021.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2021.04 release includes:

- netstats can now collect L1/L2 per neighbor statistics
- sock DTLS now allows using multiple credentials
- congure - a framework for implementing congestion control algorithms
- xfa (cross file arrays) - a mechanism to more easily define stuff across
  files (e.g., shell commands)
- nimble is now using low-power ztimer
- nrf5x now properly configures external HF clock, power use down 411µA -> 3.6µA
  for examples/minimal on nrf52dk
- many more modules and drivers have Kconfig support
- the semtech-loramac package now supports sx126x/llcc68 radios
- 8 new boards, 6 new drivers, 8 packages upgraded

We've also mostly finished our migration from mailing lists to forum.riot-os.org.

RIOT-2021.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

RIOT-2020.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2020.10 release includes:

 - Support for PicoLIBC as standard C library implementation
 - A new radio abstraction layer for ieee802.15.4 radios

The following bugs were fixed:

#14670: tests/lwip_sock_tcp: fix -EADDRINUSE test

#14671: pkg/lwip: Use IS_ACTIVE() and bugfix
    - pkg/lwip: Compatibility with IS_USED()

#14817: gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb: Check possibly uninitialized pointers


RIOT-2020.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2020.07 release puts a focus on the improvement of automated testing. In
that vein, various new CI integrations such as CircleCI for documentation
building and online presentation, and Github Actions to check the tooling of
RIOT when merged. The `riotctrl_shell` python module allows to abstract shell
commands as python methods for testing using the newly created `riotctrl`
python package [1]. Kconfig migration reached phase 2 with various board
features being exposed to Kconfig. New network protocols were ported for RIOT
such as MQTT (in form of the `paho-mqtt` package) and the lookup client
component for CoRE RD `cord_lc`. The OpenWSN network stack with 6TiSCH support
was reintegrated into RIOT. Support for several new boards and new sensors was
added. Additionally, this release contains a number of bug fixes and test
improvements.

546 pull requests, composed of 10452 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and 84 issues have been solved. 64 people contributed with
code in 106 days. 2371 files have been touched with 822149 (+) insertions and
700313 deletions (-).

RIOT-2020.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2020.04 release includes:

- Add support for 6LoWPAN IPv6 extension header next header compression
- Add support for DHCPv6 prefix delegation client

RIOT-2020.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

RIOT-2019.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2019.10 release includes:

 - initial support for SUIT firmware updates
 - USB CDC-ACM serial communication
 - complete rewrite of TI CC110x radio driver
 - initial support for IPv6 fragmentation
 - DTLS support in the sock networking stack
 - complete blockwise messaging for gcoap and nanocoap
 - as always, bug fixes and documentation updates

About 460 pull requests, composed of 950 commits, have been merged since the
last release, and about 60 issues have been solved. 57 people contributed with
code in 105 days. Approximately 2000 files have been touched with 129000
insertions and 25000 deletions.

RIOT-2019.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2019.07 release includes a number of new features including many new
boards and cpu, riotboot added to many new and old boards, USB is now available,
BLE improvements, Ethernet on stm32 platforms, as well as many bug fixes and
documentation updates.  Testing has also improved with both On-Target Testing
increasing and now Hardware Assisted Automated Tests being run.

About 300 pull requests with about 659 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 50 issues have been solved. 26 people contributed with code
in 106 days. Approximately 1377 files have been touched with 181993 insertions
and 19668 deletions.

RIOT-2019.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2019.04 release includes a number of new features including porting of
riotboot to a number of new platforms, 802.15.4 support on the nRF52, and the
ability for firmware to flash images into a separate boot slot. Support for
several new boards and new sensors was added. Additionally, this release
contains a number of bug fixes and test improvements.

About 320 pull requests with about 569 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 40 issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code
in 88 days. Approximately 825 files have been touched with 32716 insertions
and 5149 deletions.

RIOT-2019.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2019.01 release includes a number of new features including DMA support on
all STM32 boards, WiFi with IP connectivity on ESP32 and ESP8266, and riotboot,
a simple bootloader supporting multiple firmware slots, compatible with most Arm
Cortex-M boards supported by RIOT. Support for several new boards and new sensors
was added, as well as for the new CPU architecture Armv8-M (Cortex-M23). Last
but not least, this release contains a number of bug fixes and enhances test
automation.

About 387 pull requests with about 912 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 36 issues have been solved. 54 people contributed with code
in 110 days. Approximately 1554 files have been touched with 176241 insertions
and 50593 deletions.

RIOT-2018.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================

The 2018.10 release includes new features, like CoAP Resource Directory and
Block2, ESP32 support, rework of I2C interface, EEPROM registry,
Full and Minimal Thread Devices support in OpenThread and compliance of
LoRaWAN 1.0.2 (ABP counters stored in EEPROM). Several boards were introduced.

During the last release the board documentation was migrated from the wiki to
the [RIOT API documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org) to improve the
maintenance of these entries and provide a better user experience when
browsing the documentation. There were also some efforts in grouping some
modules to make them easier to access in the documentation.

There were also some efforts on refactoring, test improvements and bug fixes.

About 392 pull requests with about 914 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 20 issues have been solved. 57 people contributed with code
in 100 days. Approximately 2184 files have been touched with 211964 insertions
and 34806 deletions.

RIOT-2018.04 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers as well as
light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.


About this release:
===================
The 2018.04 release includes major progress in support for current crypto
libraries.  A lot of work has gone into updating drivers to RIOT's unified
configuration scheme.  Support for ten new boards has been added.  In our quest
to improve and automate testing, many test scripts have been fixed and
improved, and RIOT's CI now runs many tests on real hardware during its nightly
build testing. And as usual, many tiny fixes and improvements have been merged.

About 390 pull requests with about 1073 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 54 issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code
in 98 days. Approximately 1491 files have been touched with 208426 insertions.

licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
Most notable, this release is bringing RIOT a step closer to supporting
over-the-air-updates by containing initial support for MCUBoot.
Furthermore, it adds support for some new platforms (e.g. arduino-mkzero,
nucleos, and frdm-k22f), drivers (e.g. my9221, apa102, ds1307), and of course
a large number of bug fixes (e.g. `make buildtest` now working properly,
various fixes to `xtimer`).

About 390 pull requests with about 500 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 60 issues have been solved. 39 people contributed with code
in 113 days. 1825 files have been touched with 223454 insertions and 66146 deletions.

===================================================================================
#2006: cpu/nrf51822: timer callback may be fired too early
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list:
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#4694: drivers/lm75a: does not build
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5128: make: buildtest breaks when exporting FEATURES_PROVIDED var
#5207: make: buildest fails with board dependent application Makefiles
#5361: cpu/cc26x0: timer broken
#5460: cpu/samd21: i2c timing with compiler optimization
#5489: cpu/lpc11u34: ADC broken
#5799: kw2x: 15.4 duplicate transmits
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in there board_init()
       function. The xtimer is however first initialized in the auto_init module which is executed
       after board_init()
#6022: pkg: build order issue
#6331: RTC alarm triggered with 1s delay
#6419: cpu/cc2538: timer broken

#6501: boards/nucleo: Pin usage collision (SPI clk vs. LED0)
#6542: boards/nucle-f0xx: misconfigured timer configuration
#6904: cpu/saml21: cannot use several EXTI

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision
       which is not required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#4048: gnrc: potential racey memory leak
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some operations mutexes to the
       network interfaces need to get unlocked in the current implementation to not get deadlocked.
       Recursive mutexes as provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of size ~512 B might lead
       to crashes. The issue describes this for several hundred nodes, but aggressive flooding with

RIOT-2017.07 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are typically
found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit
microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, soft
real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API
access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features, fixes and enhancements. Among others these features
contain an initial - still experimental - TCP implementation based on the GNRC network stack, support
for reading from and writing to SD cards, a new power management architecture as well additional third
party packages such as TweetNaCl, a cryptographic library, and Heatshrink a data compression library
optimized for embedded real-time systems.
We added support for new platforms including the Calliope mini, Maple mini, and a couple of STMs
Nucleo boards. Device support was extended by several new drivers, e.g., for NXP PN532 NFC, Microchip
MRF24J40 802.15.4 radio (experimental), or Bosch BME280 pressure/humidity/temperature sensor.
We completely refactored the SPI interface, allowing for internally handled hardware or software chip
select lines and shared bus usage for multiple devices with different SPI configurations.

About 278 pull requests with about 606 commits have been merged since the last release and about 84
issues have been solved. 44 people contributed with code in 87 days. 2230 files have been touched with
220275 insertions and 159840 deletions.

#6358: arduino uno : xtimer accuracy problem

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision
       which is not required. Changing to lower precision would save some memory.
#4048: potential racey memory leak: According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast
       destination may lead to a memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare
       case and a completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5230: gnrc ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some operations mutexes to the
       network interfaces need to get unlocked in the current implementation to not get deadlocked.
       Recursive mutexes as provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of size ~512 B might lead
       to crashes. The issue describes this for several hundred nodes, but aggressive flooding with
       just two nodes was also shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame gets lost the reassembly
       state machine might get out of sync
#6123: gnrc: crash with (excessive) traffic

NDP is not working properly
---------------------------
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router solicitation might lead
       to invalid zero-length link-layer addresses in neighbor cache.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address: Under some  circumstances a router might
       send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored on receive (as RFC-4861 specifies), RAs should have
       link-local addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while: Several issues
       (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address effectively being banned from the network
       (disappears from neighbor cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by outdated ncache at router
#5539: Border Router: packet not forwarded from ethos to interface 6
#5790: ND: Lost of Global IPV6 on node after sending lot of UDP frame from BR

--------------------
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list: Under some conditions an xtimer can end up twice in the
       internal list of the xtimer module
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe for non-32-bit platforms.
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in there board_init()
       function. The xtimer is however first initialized in the auto_init module which is executed
       after board_init()
#6052: tests: xtimer_drift gets stuck: xtimer_drift application freezes after ~30-200 seconds
#6331: RTC alarm triggered with 1s delay
#6419: cpu/cc2538: timer broken
#6427: xtimer: infinite loop with xtimer_mutex_lock_timeout
#6502: cpu/stm32l1: RTC broken
#6542: boards/nucle-f0xx: misconfigured timer configuration (fix in #6494)

RIOT-2016.10 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community) and is
licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows indirect
business models around the free open-source software platform provided by
RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release provides a lot of new features as well as it  fixes several major
bugs. Among these new features are the new simplified network socket API
called sock, the GNRC specific CoAP implementation gcoap and several new
packages: TinyDTLS, the Aversive++ microcontroller library for robotics, the
u8g2 graphic library, and nanocoap.
Using the new sock API an implementation of the Simple Time Network Protocol
(SNTP) was also introduced, allowing for time synchronization between nodes.
New platforms include the Arduino Uno, the Arduino Duemilanove, the Arduino
Zero, SODAQ Autonomo, and the Zolertia remote (rev. B).
The most significant bug fix was done in native which led to a significantly
more robust handling of ISRs and now allows for at least 1,000 native
instances running stably on one machine.

About 263 pull requests with about 398 commits have been merged since the last
release and about 42 issues have been solved. 37 people contributed with code
in 100 days. 1006 files have been touched with 166500 insertions and 26926
deletions.

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#534:  native debugging on osx fails
#2071: native: *long* overdue fixes
#3341: netdev_tap crashes when hammered
#5007: gnrc icmpv6: Ping reply goes out the wrong interface
#5432: native: valgrind fails

Known Issues
============
Networking related issues
-------------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision: NHDP works with timer values
       of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing to lower
       precision would save some memory.
#4048: potential racey memory leak: According to the packet buffer stats,
       flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a memory leak due to
       a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a completely
       filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#4388: POSIX sockets: open socket is bound to a specific thread: This was an
       inherit problem of the conn API under GNRC. Since the POSIX sockets are
       still based on conn for this release, this issue persists
#4527: gnrc_ipv6: Multicast is not forwarded if routing node listens to the
       address (might still be fixable for release, see #5729, #5230: gnrc
       ipv6: multicast packets are not dispatched to the upper layers)
#5016: gnrc_rpl: Rejoining RPL instance as root after reboot messes up routing
#5055: cpuid: multiple radios will get same EUI-64 Nodes with multiple
       interfaces might get the same EUI-64 for them since they are generated
       from the same CPU ID.
#5656: Possible Weakness with locking in the GNRC network stack: For some
       operations mutexes to the network interfaces need to get unlocked in
       the current implementation to not get deadlocked. Recursive mutexes as
       provided in #5731 might help to solve this problem.
#5748: gnrc: nodes crashing with too small packet buffer: A packet buffer of
       size ~512 B might lead to crashes. The issue describes this for several
       hundred nodes, but aggressive flooding with just two nodes was also
       shown to lead to this problem.
#5858: gnrc: 6lo: potential problem with reassembly of fragments: If one frame
       gets lost the reassembly state machine might get out of sync

### NDP is not working properly
#4499: handle of l2src_len in gnrc_ndp_rtr_sol_handle: Reception of a router
       solicitation might lead to invalid zero-length link-layer addresses in
       neighbor cache.
#5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address: Under some
       circumstances a router might send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored
       on receive (as RFC 4861 specifies), RAs should have link-local
       addresses and not even be send out this way.
#5122: NDP: global unicast address on non-6LBR nodes disappears after a while:
       Several issues (also see #5760) lead to a global unicast address
       effectively being banned from the network (disappears from neighbor
       cache, is not added again)
#5467: ipv6 address vanishes when ARO (wrongly) indicates DUP caused by
       outdated ncache at router
#5539: Border Router: packet not forwarded from ethos to interface 6
#5790: ND: Lost of Global IPV6 on node after sending lot of UDP frame from BR


Timer related issues
--------------------
#4841: xtimer: timer already in the list: Under some conditions an xtimer can
       end up twice in the internal list of the xtimer module
#4902: xtimer: xtimer_set: xtimer_set does not handle integer overflows well
#5338: xtimer: xtimer_now() not ISR safe for non-32-bit platforms.
#5928: xtimer: usage in board_init() crashes: some boards use the xtimer in
       there board_init() function. The xtimer is however first initialized in
       the auto_init module which is executed after board_init()
#6052: tests: xtimer_drift gets stuck: xtimer_drift application freezes after
       ~30-200 seconds


native related issues
---------------------
#495:  native not float safe: When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context
       switch occurs, either the stack gets corrupted or a floating point
       exception occurs.
#2175: ubjson: valgind registers "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests
#4590: pkg: building relic with clang fails.
#5796: native: tlsf: early malloc will lead to a crash: TLSF needs pools to be
       initialized (which is currently expected to be done in an application).
       If a malloc is needed before an application's main started (e.g. driver
       initialization) the node can crash, since no pool is allocated yet.

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#1891: newlib-nano: Printf formatting does not work properly for some numeric
       types: PRI[uxdi]64, PRI[uxdi]8 and float are not parsed in newlib-nano

#4522: avsextrem: linker sometimes doesn't find `bl_init_clks()`
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc oonf_api is not building with
       clang. (Partly solved by #4593)
#4694: drivers/lm75a: does not build
#4737: cortex-m: Hard fault after a thread exits (under some circumstances)
#4822: kw2xrf: packet loss when packets get fragmented
#4876: at86rf2xx: Simultaneous use of different transceiver types is not
       supported
#4954: chronos: compiling with -O0 breaks
#4866: not all GPIO driver implementations are thread safe: Due to non-atomic
       operations in the drivers some pin configurations might get lost.
#5009: RIOT is saw-toothing in energy consumption (even when idling)
#5103: xtimer: weird behavior of tests/xtimer_drift: xtimer_drift randomly
       jumps a few seconds on nrf52
#5361: cpu/cc26x0: timer broken
#5405: Erratic timings on iotlab-m3 with compression context activated

#3256: make: Setting constants on compile time doesn't really set them
       everywhere

and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which allows
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT.

About this release:
===================
This release adds support for two additional network stacks: lwIP and emb6.
A bunch of additional protocols are now available, P2P-RPL in the GNRC
network stack, Ethernet-over-Serial (ethos). Murdock, the new, blazing fast
RIOT CI is now available to significantly speed up code merging procedures.

This release also adds support for a number of new boards and sensors and a new
tool for automated border router setup is now provided which greatly simplifies
that setup for newbies as well as for old-timers. Last but not least: this
release includes a number of bug fixes, mostly about stabilizing and enhancing
the networking capabilities of RIOT.

About 470 pull requests with about 1196 commits have been merged since the last
release and 127 additional issues have been solved. 55 people contributed code
in 124 days. 1521 files have been touched with ~91700 insertions and ~42200
deletions.

* #3970: RPL: Advertise DODAG only over the assigned interface
* #4462: IPHC/NHC broken between Linux and a RIOT node with a RIOT-based border router in between.
* #4608: tests/xtimer_usleep_until: unstable behaviour

Known Issues
==========
----------------------
* #3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision
    NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing
    to lower precision would save some memory.
* #3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
    The size of the link-layer header is not dynamically calculated, but instead the maximum
    size is always assumed.
* #4048: potential racey memory leak
    According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a
    memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a
    completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
* #5005: ndp: router advertisement sent with global address
    Under some circumstances a router might send RAs with GUAs. While they are ignored
    on receive (as RFC 4861 specifies), RAs should have link-local addresses and not even
    be send out this way.

RIOT-2015.12 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit
microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).

About this release:
===================
This release is mostly a clean-up and bug-fixing release. Besides that, it introduces SAUL,
the [S]ensor [A]ctuator [U]ber [L]ayer, which offers a unified API to interact with all
different types of sensors and actuators on RIOT supported hardware. Furthermore, it re-enables
the support for ICN by integrating CCN-Lite as a package. A lot of new overall documentation was
added and existing documentation was improved (http://riot-os.org/api/). In addition,
a Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration file was added to the RIOT repository in
order to create reproducible and portable environments that contain all necessary toolchains.

About 222 pull requests with about 631 commits have been merged since the last release and 48
additional issues have been solved. 37 people contributed code in 102 days. 980 files have been
touched with ~59779 insertions and ~12115 deletions.

    Documentation about how to discover and set the serial number of CMSIS-DAP chips is missing
#3201: Odd length packet snips cause invalid check sum
    If an odd length packet snip occurs in a packet and is not the last snip
    (in the order the packet is supposed to be, not in the list's order)
    in a packet it will generate a wrong check sum.

Known Issues
============

network related issues
----------------------
#3075: nhdp: unnecessary microsecond precision
    NHDP works with timer values of microsecond precision which is not required. Changing
    to lower precision would save some memory.
#3086: Max. packet length for AT86RF2XX
    The size of the link-layer header is not dynamically calculated, but instead the maximum
    size is always assumed.
#3970: RPL: Advertise DODAG only over the assigned interface
     gnrc_rpl seems to multicast DIOs over all interfaces, though gnrc_rpl_init expects an
     interface as parameter and sets the RPL-nodes multicast address only for that interface.
#4048: potential racey memory leak
     According to the packet buffer stats, flood-pinging a multicast destination may lead to a
     memory leak due to a race condition. However, it seems to be a rare case and a
     completely filled up packet buffer was not observed.
#4462: IPHC/NHC broken between Linux and a RIOT node with a RIOT-based border router in between.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#3341 and #3824: nativenet crashes when hammered
    Flood-pinging a native instance from more than one host (either multiple threads on the
    host system or multiple other native instances), leads to a SEGFAULT.
#4608: tests/xtimer_usleep_until: unstable behaviour
    The test starts to output "too large difference" and fails after a random period of time.

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#4560: make: clang is more pedantic than gcc
    oonf_api is not building with clang.
#4583: cpp11: clang doesn't allow `mutex_t` to be used with `constexpr`
    All cpp11-* tests fail with clang.

other issues
------------
#2761: core: define default flags
    If a thread is created without the corresponding flag  (CREATE_STACKTEST),
    the ps command will yield wrong numbers for the stack usage
#2927: core: Automatically select the lowest possible LPM mode
    Not all available low power modes (LPMs) are implemented for each platform and the
    concept of how the LPM is chosen needs some reconsideration
#2967: Makefile.features: location is not relevant for all features
    Provided features for the build system should be split up into a board and cpu specific
    part
#3109: periph/random: random_read should return unsigned int
    The documentation of this function does not match corresponding implementation.
#4488: Making the newlib thread-safe
    When calling puts/printf after thread_create(), the CPU hangs for DMA enabled uart drivers.

    According to Wireshark, ICMPv6 neighbor advertisements are malformed (wrong
    checksum or other reasons).

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.

    After changing the channel via a shell command, the channel reverts back to an arbitrary
    value. However, this might be only a shell problem.
#1753: vtimer_msg test crashes after ~49'20"
    dependent on the platform, vtimer stops working after some time.
#1891: printf formatting does not work properly on some Cortex platforms for 64 bit numbers
    This problem happens mostly for the Newlib nano, which does not support 64 bit integer
    printing, but sometimes happens also with other toolchains.
#1964 and #1955: eventual problems with IoT-LAB M3 nodes in the testbed
    The shell is sometimes not properly working after a reboot and the PDR is sometimes
    worse than expected.
#2143: tests.core doesn't compile for all platforms
    For some missing GCC compiler builtins, the unittests do not compile for MSP430
    platforms.
#2228: samd21 stack sizes are too small
    The application examples/default for example will crash when issuing the txtsnd command

other issues:
--------------
#1449: a removed vtimer might still get called back by hwtimer
    The timer callback might still fire even after vtimer_remove() was called.
#2175: valgrind registers "Invalid write of size 4" in unittests for ubjson
     According to valgrind the stack gets corrupted in UBJSON.

RIOT-2014.05 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: from 16-bit
microcontrollers to light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#45: bit field order in the fcf may be wrong
    The CC2420 FIFO expects the IEEE802.15.4 FCF field in reversed bit order.
    With this release the byte order is now handled by the net_if module and
    all device specific handling is done by the driver.
#82: Setting STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED thread to STATUS_PENDING though it is not
     handled yet
    In some rare cases the status of a thread might falsely change to
    STATUS_PENDING instead of STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED.
#455: sha256 is broken on MSP430
    Fixed.
#498: native is segfaulting at startup
    Fixed by several PRs (#501, #583, and #588).
#505: native on FreeBSD is broken
    Fixed by PR #1022.

Known Issues
============
network related issues
----------------------
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#861: neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN not working
    Duplicate address detection according to RFC 6775 is also missing.

native related issues
---------------------
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#534: native debugging on osx fails
    Using valgrind or gdb with a nativenet target in OSX leads to "the network"
    being stuck (gdb) or the whole process being stuck (valgrind).
#715: test_hwtimer_wait fails on native
    The problem appears to be lost signals and depends on the CPU speed.
#787: reboot not working with open file descriptors on native
    If for example a tap device is in use, the reboot command fails.
#862: sometimes the tap bridge does not work in native
    Sometimes (rather suddenly) packages are not received by a TAP and won't be
    received even if I reconfigure the bridge.
#1127: Random build fails on OSX
    Building for native on OSX often fails - Workaround: build using  -B  flag,
    e.g.:  make -B clean all

other platform related issues
-----------------------------
#426: Interrupt handling on MSP430 is buggy
    UART and timer handling is currently unstable on MSP430 based platforms
#1232: x86 doesn't build on OS X with clang
    Current version of the x86 port doesn't build for OS X with clang.
