The friendly Operating System for IoT!

## FEATURES
RIOT OS is an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is based on a microkernel and designed for
* energy efficiency
* hardware independent development
* a high degree of modularity

Its features comprise
* a preemptive, tickless scheduler with priorities
* flexible memory management
* high resolution, long-term timers
* support for AVR, MSP430, ARM7, and ARM Cortex-M on over 50 boards
* the native port allows to run RIOT as-is on Linux, BSD, and MacOS. Multiple instances of RIOT running on a single machine can also be interconnected via a simple virtual Ethernet bridge
* IPv6
* 6LoWPAN (RFC4944, RFC6282, and RFC6775)
* UDP
* RPL (storing mode)
* CoAP
* CCN-Lite

## GETTING STARTED
* You want to start the RIOT? Just follow our [Getting started documentation](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Introduction)
* The RIOT API itself can be built from the code using doxygen. The latest version is uploaded daily to http://riot-os.org/api.

### USING THE NATIVE PORT WITH NETWORKING
If you compile RIOT for the native cpu and include the `netdev2_tap` module, you can specify a network interface like this: `PORT=tap0 make term`

#### SETTING UP A TAP NETWORK
There is a shellscript in `RIOT/dist/tools/tapsetup` called `tapsetup` which you can use to create a network of tap interfaces.

*USAGE*
To create a bridge and two (or count at your option) tap interfaces:

    ./dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup [-c [<count>]]
