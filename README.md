The friendly Operating System for IoT!

RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things (IoT):
8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).
RIOT is licensed with LGPLv2.1, a copyleft license which fosters
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT, e.g. it is possible to link closed-source code with the
LGPL code.

## Features

RIOT provides features including, but not limited to:

* a preemptive, tickless scheduler with priorities
* flexible memory management
* high resolution, long-term timers
* MTD abstraction layer
* File System integration
* support 200+ boards based on AVR, MSP430, ESP8266, ESP32, RISC-V,
  ARM7 and ARM Cortex-M
* the native port allows to run RIOT as-is on Linux and BSD.
  Multiple instances of RIOT running on a single machine can also be
  interconnected via a simple virtual Ethernet bridge or via a simulated
  IEEE 802.15.4 network (ZEP)
* IPv6
* 6LoWPAN (RFC4944, RFC6282, and RFC6775)
* UDP
* RPL (storing mode, P2P mode)
* CoAP
* OTA updates via SUIT
* MQTT
* USB (device mode)
* Display / Touchscreen support
* CCN-Lite
* LoRaWAN
* UWB
* Bluetooth (BLE) via [NimBLE](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble)

## Getting RIOT

The most convenient way to get RIOT is to clone it via Git

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT
```

this will ensure that you get all the newest features and bug fixes with the
caveat of an ever changing work environment.

If you prefer things more stable, you can download the source code of one of our
quarter annual releases [via Github][releases] as ZIP file or tarball. You can
also checkout a release in a cloned Git repository using

```console
$ git pull --tags
$ git checkout <YYYY.MM>
```

For more details on our release cycle, check our [documentation][release cycle].
