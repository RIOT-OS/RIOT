The friendly Operating System for IoT!

## FEATURES
RIOT OS is an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is based on a microkernel and designed for
* energy efficiency
* hardware independent development
* a high degree of modularity

Its features comprise
* a preemptive, tickless scheduler with priorities
* flexible memory management
* high resolution timers
* virtual, long-term timers
* the native port allows to run RIOT as-is on Linux, BSD, and MacOS. Multiple instances of RIOT running on a single machine can also be interconnected via a simple virtual Ethernet bridge
* Wiselib support (C++ algorithm library, including routing, clustering, timesync, localization, security and more algorithms)
* IPv6
* TCP and UDP
* 6LoWPAN
* RPL

## GETTING STARTED
* You want to start the RIOT? Just follow our [Getting started documentation](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Introduction)
* The RIOT API itself can be built from the code using doxygen. The latest version is uploaded daily to http://riot-os.org/api.

### USING THE NATIVE PORT WITH NETWORKING
If you compile RIOT for the native cpu and include the nativenet module, you can specify a network interface like this: `PORT=tap0 make term`

#### SETTING UP A TAP NETWORK
There is a shellscript in `RIOT/cpu/native` called `tapsetup.sh` which you can use to create a network of tap interfaces.

*USAGE*
To create a bridge and two (or count at your option) tap interfaces:
./tapsetup.sh create [count]

### EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
In the `examples` directory you can find some example applications. The `default` application demonstrates all available features for the current platform.

For example, you can use it to the test the native networking by running two instances: `make term PORT=tap0` and `make term PORT=tap1`. Now configure two different addresses for both RIOT instances by typing `addr 1` and `addr 2` respectively and send a text message from one "node" to another by typing `txtsnd 2 hello` on the first "node".
