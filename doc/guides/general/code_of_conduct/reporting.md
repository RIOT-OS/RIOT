description: How to report violations of the RIOT Code of Conduct
---

If you believe someone is violating the [Code of Conduct](/general/code_of_conduct/)
we ask that you report it to us by emailing <conduct@riot-os.org>.
Currently, the recipients of
this email address are [\@OlegHahm](https://github.com/OlegHahm) (Oleg Hahm) and
[\@miri64](https://github.com/miri64) (Martine Lenders).

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a
public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all
victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still
report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take
no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look
negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about
incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help
us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

-   Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
-   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
    were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
-   When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
-   Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
    forum post, a mailing list archive, or a public Matrix chat link) please include a link.
-   Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
-   If you believe this incident is ongoing.
-   Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from one of the core community members as soon as
possible. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for
much quicker than that).

They will review the incident and determine:

-   What happened.
-   Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
-   Who the bad actor was.
-   Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
    physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
their immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the
situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

-   Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
-   A private reprimand from us to the individual(s) involved.
-   A public reprimand.
-   An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from the forum,
    the Matrix chats, or a mailing list).
-   A permanent or temporary ban from some or all RIOT spaces (forum, Matrix chats, mailing lists,
    etc.)
-   A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.
