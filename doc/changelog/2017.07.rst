RIOT-2017.07 - Release Notes
============================

RIOT is a multi-threading operating system which enables soft real-time
capabilities and comes with support for a range of devices that are
typically found in the Internet of Things: 8-bit microcontrollers,
16-bit microcontrollers and light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency,
soft real-time capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and
uniform API access, independent of the underlying hardware (with partial
POSIX compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open-source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community)
and is licensed with a non-viral copyleft license (LGPLv2.1), which
allows indirect business models around the free open-source software
platform provided by RIOT.
