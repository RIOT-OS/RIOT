# This wrapper takes the arguments: <ar> <operation> <archive> <files...>
# <ar> can be any ar implementation.
# <operations>, <archive> and <files...> are the normal arguments to <ar>.
#
# OS X's ar implementation has the problem, that it refuses to create empty archives.
# This wrapper will copy a provided empty .a file to <archive> if it was told to.

# If <operations> contains "r", and there are no <files...> given.
