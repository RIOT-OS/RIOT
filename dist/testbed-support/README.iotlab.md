# RIOT integration into IoT-LAB

Check the Wiki to see how to build and run RIOT on FIT IoT-LAB:
https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab/wiki/Riot-support

## Control IoT-LAB via Make

### Requirements

This feature requires to have a valid account for the FIT IoT-LAB
(registration there is open for everyone) and the
[iot-lab/cli-tools](https://github.com/iot-lab/cli-tools) to be installed.

### Description

The folder `dist/testbed-support/` contains a `Makefile.iotlab` that defines
some targets to control RIOT experiments on IoT-LAB using the GNU Make build
system. In order to use this, one has to include this Makefile at the end of
the application's Makefile, like this:
```
include $(RIOTBASE)/dist/testbed-support/Makefile.iotlab
```
### Variables

This Makefile introduces some additional variables (default values in
brackets):
 * IOTLAB_NODES (5)
 * IOTLAB_DURATION (30 minutes)
 * IOTLAB_SITE (grenoble.iot-lab.info)
 * IOTLAB_TYPE (m3:at86rf231)
 * IOTLAB_AUTH ($HOME/.iotlabrc)
 * IOTLAB_USER (taken from $IOTLAB_AUTH)
 * IOTLAB_EXP_ID (taken from first experiment in running state)
 * IOTLAB_EXP_NAME (RIOT_EXP)
 * IOTLAB_PHY_NODES
 * IOTLAB_EXCLUDE_NODES

### Format of a Resource ID
Both variables `IOTLAB_PHY_NODES` and `IOTLAB_EXCLUDE_NODES` use the resource id
string format as specified in the output of `experiment-cli submit --help`.
An example would be: 1-3+7+10-13

### Targets

It defines the following targets:
 * iotlab-exp
 * iotlab-flash
 * iotlab-reset
 * iotlab-term

**Please note:** All targets that require an already running experiment will
use the first experiment of the user that has already entered state "Running"
if `IOTLAB_EXP_ID` is not set.

#### iotlab-exp

This schedules a new experiment on the FIT IoT-LAB and waits until it enters
"Running" state. It will request `IOTLAB_NODES` nodes of type `IOTLAB_TYPE`
for `IOTLAB_DURATION` minutes at site `IOTLAB_SITE`. With `IOTLAB_PHY_NODES`
it is possible to choose specific nodes for this experiment by using the resource id
string format as described above.
Note that the usage of `IOTLAB_PHY_NODES` ignores `IOTLAB_NODES`. It will also flash the
binary of the current application to all registered nodes. The name of the
experiment is set to "RIOT_EXP" or "RIOT_EXP_$(IOTLAB_EXP_NAME)"
if `IOTLAB_EXP_NAME` is defined.

#### iotlab-flash

This target updates the application on all registered nodes of the given
experiment to the current version of the application.
Certain nodes can be excluded by listing them in the `IOTLAB_EXCLUDE_NODES` variable
using the resource id string format as described above. If you do not use the default site,
then you must specify the site with `IOTLAB_SITE`.

#### iotlab-reset

This target resets all registered nodes of the given experiment.
Certain nodes can be excluded by listing them in the `IOTLAB_EXCLUDE_NODES` variable
using the resource id string format as described above. If you do not use the default site,
then you must specify the site with `IOTLAB_SITE`.

#### iotlab-term

Uses ssh to login the user on the IoT-LAB server of the specified site and
start the `serial_aggregator` to communication with all registered nodes.
