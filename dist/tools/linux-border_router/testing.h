 * @brief   Test suite for the 6LoWPAN Border Router.
 *
 *          The tests are managed in the following way:
 *          Packets (ICMPv6 Echo Request) are send onto the sensor node
 *          via the serial interface. The user can then decide what she
 *          wants to measure by calling testing_start() to start the
 *          measuring and testing_stop() to end it.
