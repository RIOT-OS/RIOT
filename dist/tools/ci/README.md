CI specific scripts
===================

Static tests
------------

The [static_tests.sh] script runs all static tests and outputs them in a unified
output. You can also run this script by running `make static-test` in the base
directory.

To add a new static test, just write a `check.sh` script or call your static
checker directly and add it to the list of static tests in [static_tests.sh]:

```sh
ENV1=foobar ENV2=snafu run <your test command> --args
```

Github annotations
------------------
Using [github_annotate.sh] you can generate [Github annotations] for your
tests. You can generate both warnings and errors. Before doing anything however,
you include [github_annotate.sh]\ (assuming `${RIOTTOOLS is set to}` [dist/tools/])

```sh
. "${RIOTTOOLS}"/ci/github_annotate.sh
```

and set-up the mechanism

```sh
github_annotate_setup
```

If your tests generate output you now can pipe that to the file `${LOGFILE}` by
using `${LOG}`, e.g.

```sh
my_awesome_test | ${LOG}
```

Don't worry, your test will function normal still, if you don't run it in a
Github Action!

Now you can use `github_annotate_error` and `github_annotate_warning` to
generate the actual errors and warnings. Both commands expect 3 parameters:
1. `FILENAME`: The name of the file the warning or error occurred in,
2. `LINENUM`: The number of the line the warning or error occurred in, and
3. `DETAILS`: Some descriptive details or the message of your warning or error.

You can parse those from `${LOGFILE}` (e.g. using tools such as `grep`, `sed`,
or `awk`) or generate them on the fly, if your script allows for that. E.g.

```sh
cat ${LOGFILE} | grep '^.*:[0-9]\+:' | while read error; do
    github_annotate_error \
        $(echo "${error}" | cut -d: -f1) \
        $(echo "${error}" | cut -d: -f2) \
        $(echo "${error}" | cut -d: -f3-)
done
```

If your output has the common output format `<filename>:<lineno>:<details>` you
can also use the function `github_annotate_parse_log_default`. It takes the
annotation function it should call on every line as an optional parameter with
`github_annotate_error` being the default. E.g.

```sh
github_annotate_parse_log_default github_annotate_warning
```

does the same as the last example snippet, but uses `github_annotate_warning`
instead.

If you do not need to provide a file with your error or warning, you can also
use `github_annotate_error_no_file` or `github_annotate_warning_no_file`,
respectively. Both take a just message as single parameter:

```sh
github_annotate_error_no_file "Something is wrong!"
```

After all errors or warnings are annotated, call `github_annotate_teardown` to
finish annotations.

**Note:** `github_annotate_report_last_run` is called within [static_tests.sh]
to attach the actual annotations to your PR. You don't need to call it from
within your test if you are adding that test to [static_tests.sh].
