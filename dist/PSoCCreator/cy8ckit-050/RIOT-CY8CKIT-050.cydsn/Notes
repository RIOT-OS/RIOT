 - RIOT_VERSION is added as manually.
 - reset handler(cpu) is calling board_init(board) and board_init also calling cpu_init() : Is it a circular dependency
 - Why cpu object uses defines from board (e.g periph_conf.h)
 - shall I add a cpu and board group for doxygen (e.g ingroup cpu_lpc1768)
 - TODO : LPM (Low power mode) is not implemented.

 Implement syscall.c for uart outputs.
