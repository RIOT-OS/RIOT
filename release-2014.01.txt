RIOT-2014.01 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: from 16-bit
microcontrollers to light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

New features
============
Core
----
+ msg_receive() with timeout
+ LPM support for MSP430 based platforms
+ introduced a version string

Supported platforms
-------------------
Additional support for the following boards:
+ TelosB
+ mbed LPC1768

Sensor drivers
---------------
+ drivers for the LM75A Digital temperature sensor and thermal watchdog
+ SRF02 and SRF08 ultrasonic range finders

Native port
-----------
+ implemented UART via I/O redirection or TCP and UNIX socket

System libraries
----------------
+ Mersenne twister pseudorandom number generator
+ crypto libraries
  + 3des
  + aes
  + rc5
  + skipjack
  + twofish
+ BSD-like package system for easy integration of external libraries

Network stack
-------------
+ port of CCN lite
+ POSIX socket wrapper
+ integration of libcoap
+ integration of OpenWSN

Further Changes
===============
* boards and projects repositories have been integrated and are now part of
  the RIOT repository itself
* full refactoring of the network stack and introducing a substructure
  according to the modules' functionalities
* cleaned up Makefile system and simplified binary folder
* more documentation
* various bug fixes and cleanups

Fixed Issues from the last release
==================================
#83: Wrong byte order in sixlowpan
    To our best knowledge all occurrences of wrong byte order within the 6LoWPAN
    network stack are fixed now.
#132: segfault in vtimer update shortterm
    The vtimer has been carefully evaluated and all known issues concerning this
    module are fixed.

Known Issues
============
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#45: bit field order in the fcf may be wrong
    The CC2420 FIFO expects the IEEE802.15.4 FCF field in reversed bit order.
    This might break the implementation for other, upcoming radio
    transceivers.
#82: Setting STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED thread to STATUS_PENDING though it is not
     handled yet
    In some rare cases the status of a thread might falsely change to
    STATUS_PENDING instead of STATUS_REPLY_BLOCKED.
#426: Interrupt handling on MSP430 is buggy
    UART and timer handling is currently unstable on MSP430 based platforms
#455: sha256 is broken on MSP430
    For unknown reasons sha256 calculates wrong results on MSP430 based platforms.
#495: native not float safe
    When the FPU is used when an asynchronous context switch occurs, either the
    stack gets corrupted or a floating point exception occurs.
#498: native is segfaulting at startup
    In some cases (about 5-10%) a RIOT native process crashes with a SEGFAULT
    at startup.
#499: native is segfaulting on heavy network usage
    Sending more than 100 packets per second causes a SEGFAULT in RIOT native.
#505: native on FreeBSD is broken
    Due to different parameter handling in FreeBSD, native is currently not
    working there.
