# Xtimer API test

This application enables tests of xtimer API calls using the RIOT shell.
Consult the 'help' shell command for available actions.

## Requirements

The automated tests are based on RobotFramework and thus depend on additional
Python packages, namely `robotframework` and `riot_pal`.
See also the RobotFramework [README.md](../../dist/robotframework/README.md)
for more details.

## Background

As this application provides a wrapper for (basic) xtimer API calls, it allows
to implement various test cases by utilising and combining different calls.
