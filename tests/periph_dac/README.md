About
=====

This is a test application for a digital to analog converter (DAC).

This test application tries to initialize every available DAC line. If
successful, it will output a saw tooth pattern with a period of about 10Hz on
each of the available lines.

Usage
=====

Connect an oscilloscope to the DAC pins and look at the signal levels (you
should be able to clearly see the saw tooth signal in your scope)
