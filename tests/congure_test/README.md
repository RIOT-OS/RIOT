Basic tests for the CongURE API
===============================

This test tests the `congure_test` test framework used for the other CongURE
tests.

Usage
-----

The test requires an up-to-date version of `riotctrl` with `rapidjson` support:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade riotctrl[rapidjson]
```

Then simply run the application using:

```console
$ BOARD="<board>" make flash test
```

It can also executed with pytest:

```console
$ PYTHONPATH=../../dist/pythonlibs BOARD="<board>" pytest tests/01-run.py
```

Note that this only works from within the directory of the test, so if you are
somewhere else, use

```console
$ cd tests/congure_test
```

first to change into that.

Expected result
---------------

The application's test script passes without error code.
