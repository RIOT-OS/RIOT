Test PBKDF2 implementation
==========================

This test evaluates the RIOT implementation against a reference. The objective
is flexibility and clarity, and for this reason there are no hard coded vectors,
but instead the test is interactive, with the DUT processing vectors given
through the serial interface.

This means that the test is slower, but more complete and trustworthy.

The test is completely automated.
