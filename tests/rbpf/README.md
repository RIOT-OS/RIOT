# rBPF Test application

This application is a quick test for the rBPF virtual machine. It runs a
fletcher32 checksum algorithm from inside a rBPF VM. This is a relative
computational intensive application and not necessarily representative for a
real-world application. It does test through the engine thoroughly which is why
it is used here.
