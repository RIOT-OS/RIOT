# About

This is a test application for the HD44780 LCD driver. This display comes with
many Arduino starter kits under the name of LCM1602C, and typically has 16x2
columns and rows.

# Details

This test application will initialize the HD44780 driver with the configuration
as specified in the default `hd44780_params.h` file. To connect the display with
your board use the following minimal pinout for the LCD (i.e., Arduino here):

- Pin 1 is connected directly to GND.
- Pin 2 is connected directly to VCC +5V.
- Pin 3 is used to set LCD contrast, for max use +5V or a 10k potentiometer.
- Pin 4 (RS or “register select”) is connected to pin 2 on the Arduino
- Pin 5 (RW or “read/write”) is connected directly to GND, i.e., unused.
  Also note: if you connect RW to your board that the LCD is driven by 5V, while
  many boards internally run at 3.3V - so this could fry the board :/
- Pin 6 (EN or “enable”) is connected to pin 3 on the Arduino.
- Pins 7 – 10: Not connected.
- Pin 11 on the LCD is connected to pin 4 on the Arduino.
- Pin 12 on the LCD is connected to pin 5 on the Arduino.
- Pin 13 on the LCD is connected to pin 6 on the Arduino.
- Pin 14 on the LCD is connected to pin 7 on the Arduino.
- Pin 15 is connected to one end of a 1k resistor, and its other end to VCC +5V.
- Pin 16 is connected directly to GND.
