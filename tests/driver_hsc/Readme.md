## About
This is a test application for the HSC Pressure and Temperature sensor.

## Usage
The application will continue trying to initiate the HSC sensor.

After initialization, every second, the application:
* reads the temperature (Â°C);
* reads the pressure (uBar);
* prints those values to STDOUT.
