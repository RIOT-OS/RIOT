Expected result
===============
This application should infinitely print '-' characters. If it prints only a single '+' characters the test must be considered as failed.

Background
==========
This test was introduced due to an error for floating point handling in an older newlib version.

The idea for this test is taken from:
http://sourceware.org/ml/newlib/2010/msg00149.html
