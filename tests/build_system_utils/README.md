Build system utils tests
========================

This test checks the build system 'utils' functions declared in
`makefiles/utils`.

The test output says nothing in case of success.

Note
----

It should not be necessary to compile but this simplifies the integration in
murdock for the moment. Also there will be other tests that may need to check
the result of the compilation.
