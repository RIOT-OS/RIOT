### Test application for Si114X sensors family

#### Introduction

The Si114X (Si1145, Si1146 and Si1147) sensors are UV, light and proximity sensors.
More information in the [datasheet](https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents%2FTechnicalDocs%2FSi1145-46-47.pdf).

#### Expected results

After initialization, the sensor continuously (every 2 secs) displays the
IR light, the visible light, the UV index, the proximity and the value of the
response register.
