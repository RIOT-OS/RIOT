# About
This is a manual test application for the SRF08 ultrasonic ranger driver.

# Usage


After initialization, the sensor values are read periodically and printed to the STDOUT. Here, three echos are stored.

To verify the seen values you can focus the sensor against any reflecting object and vary the distance to
see especially the first measured value changing.
