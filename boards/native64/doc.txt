@brief       Support for running RIOT in native64

[Family: native](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-native)

Same board as \ref boards_native "native", but compiled for 64-bit instead of 32-bit.
Currently only Linux x86-64 is supported.
Otherwise, everything works the same as for the 32-bit version.
For more information on this board, see the \ref boards_native "native board" documentation.
