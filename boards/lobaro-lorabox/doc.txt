## Flashing
### Connections
To flash using the STM32 ROM bootloader on the board, use the provided UART-USB
bridge and connect it to the *Config* port. The *Config* port pinout is the
following:

```
---------------     ---------------
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 |     | x x x x x x |
---------------     ---------------
    Config               Addon

1: RST
2: VCC
3: RX1
4: TX1
5: Boot0
6: GND
```

### STM32 Loader
To flash RIOT on the board, after connection the UART-USB bridge, just run:
```
BOARD=lobaro-lorabox make flash
```
This uses the stm32loader script to erase the memory and flash it interfacing
with the STM32 ROM bootloader.

### Lobaro Tool
Another way of interfacing with the STM32 ROM bootloader is using the **Lobaro Maintenance Tool** provided
[online](https://www.lobaro.com/lobaro-maintenance-tool/) for free for Linux,
Mac & Windows. It allows flashing and accessing the UART.

## Connecting via Serial
The default UART port is the USART1, the same that is used for flashing, so it
is available on the *Config* port. The default port is /dev/ttyUSB0. To access
the port run:
```
BOARD=lobaro-lorabox make term
```
**Note:** If you want to access the port with a different application please
keep in mind that RTS must be set to '0' and DTR to '1' as the provided UART-USB
bridge seems to invert this lines.

## SX1272 radio
Please note that the board has a Semtech SX1272 radio. This means that when the
semtech-loramac package or the sx127x driver are used the correct driver version
(sx1272) must be selected.
