# On-board debugger uses SWD, so JTAG-only pins PA15, PB3(*), and PB4 can be
# remapped as regular GPIOs instead. (Note: PB3 is also used as SWO. The user
# needs to take care to not enable SWO with the debugger while at the same time
# PB3 is used as GPIO. But RIOT does not use SWO in any case, so if a user adds
# this feature in her/his own code, she/he should be well aware of this.)
