@brief       Support for the SODAQ Autonomo board.

## Overview

The `SODAQ Autonomo` is a board by SODAQ featuring a ATSAMD21J18A. The SAMD21
is a ARM Cortex-M0+ micro-controller.  It has 256Kb of flash memory and 32Kb of
RAM.

The Autonomo is available from the SODAQ [shop](http://shop.sodaq.com/).

## Implementation Status

Please refer to [this tracker](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/1646)
to see which projects are work in progress and who is the contact person for
this.  Notice that the initial support for the Autonomo was based on
samr21-xpro.  At some point we will add a separate issue to track changes for
this board.

| Device | ID        | Supported | Comments  |

## Flashing the device

The Autonomo has a 10 pin header compatible with the Atmel-ICE.  The standard
method for flashing RIOT to the sodaq-autonomo is using OpenOCD. For this to
work properly, **you have to make sure to use a very recent version of
OpenOCD**.  Arduino-IDE comes with openocd v0.9.0  which is known to work.  Also
Ubuntu 16.04 has openocd v0.9.0.

Refer to https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD for building OpenOCD
and make sure "cmsis-dap" and "hidapi-libusb" are enabled.

## Supported Toolchains

To build software for the autonomo board we strongly recommend the usage of
the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain.


## Known Issues / Problems

### Stack sizes
The default stack sizes have not been tuned properly yet. If in doubt why
your application crashes try increasing the default stack sizes and use `ps` to
find out how much stack is being used.
