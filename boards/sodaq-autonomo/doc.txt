@brief       Support for the SODAQ Autonomo board.

## Overview

The `SODAQ Autonomo` is a board by SODAQ featuring a ATSAMD21J18A. The SAMD21
is a ARM Cortex-M0+ micro-controller.  It has 256Kb of flash memory and 32Kb of
RAM.

The Autonomo is available from the SODAQ [shop](http://shop.sodaq.com/).

## Implementation Status

Please refer to [this tracker](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/1646)
to see which projects are work in progress and who is the contact person for
this.  Notice that the initial support for the Autonomo was based on
samr21-xpro.  At some point we will add a separate issue to track changes for
this board.

| Device | ID        | Supported | Comments  |
|:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| MCU        | samd21    | partly    | Energy saving modes not fully utilized|
| Low-level driver | GPIO    | yes       | |
|        | PWM       | yes       | |
|        | UART      | yes       | two UARTs by now|
|        | I2C       | yes       | |
|        | SPI       | yes       | |
|        | ADC       | yes       | PA04 & PA05 disabled by default due to EDBG's use of them for UART, can be enabled from `periph_conf.h`|
|        | USB       | no        | |
|        | RTT       | yes       | |

## Features of the board

Besides the SAMD21 the board has the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|:------ |:--- |
| Compatibility        | Arduino M0 compatible |
| Size                 | 58.5 x 33.5 mm |
| Operating Voltage    | 3.3V |
| Digital I/O Pins     | 16, with 12 PWM, UART, SPI and TWI (I2C) |
| Analog Input Pins    | 6, 12-bit ADC channels |
| Analog Output Pins   | 10-bit DAC |
| External Interrupts  | Available on all pins except pin 4 |
| DC Current per I/O pin | 7 mA |
| EEPROM               | Up to 16KB by emulation |
| Clock Speed          | 48 MHz |
| Debug                | Serial Wire Interface |
| Communications       | Bee compatible slot for communication modules with software switchable power |
| Storage              | 16Mbit Dataflash Module and Micro SD card holder |
| Power                | 5V USB power and/or 3.7V LiPo battery |
| Power switch         | Software switchable power for connected devices up to 1A |
| Charging             | Solar charge controller, up to 500mA charge current|
| LED's                | Yellow charge LED and green LED on pin 13 |

## Flashing the device

Use `BOARD=sodaq-autonomo` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
     make BOARD=sodaq-autonomo -C examples/basic/hello-world flash
```

@note     If the application crashes, automatic reflashing via USB, as explained
          above won't be possible. In this case, the board must be set in
          bootloader mode by double tapping the reset button before running the
          flash command.

## Accessing STDIO via UART

STDIO of RIOT is directly available over the USB port.

The `TERM_DELAY` environment variable can be used to add a delay (in second)
before opening the serial terminal. The default value is 2s which should be
enough in most of the situation.

## Supported Toolchains

To build software for the autonomo board we strongly recommend the usage of
the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain.


## Known Issues / Problems

### Stack sizes
The default stack sizes have not been tuned properly yet. If in doubt why
your application crashes try increasing the default stack sizes and use `ps` to
find out how much stack is being used.
