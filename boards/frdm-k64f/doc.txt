The board has an integrated debugger adapter (k20dx128) with the firmware from
ARMmbed.
There are three interfaces available:
* Drag-n-drop programming over Mass Storage Device
* USB Serial Port (/dev/ttyACMx) connected to a K64F UART interface
* CMSIS-DAP for debugging with e.g. OpenOCD

**Please update the firmware to version 0221, see below.**

## OpenOCD
The latest (01.07.2015) OpenOCD version (also current git) does not support
the K64F. There is a [patch](http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/2773/) which makes
flashing and debugging possible. A refactored and rebased version can be found
[here](https://github.com/jfischer-phytec-iot/openocd/tree/wip%40phytec).<br>

## Flashing the Device
#### Over OpenOCD
make BOARD=frdm-k64f flash

#### Over MSD
Simply mount the mbed Mass Storage Device und copy new RIOT firmware.
See also the ARMmbed
[instructions](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/#getting-started-
with-mbed).

## Updating the Booloader
A update of CMSIS-DAP firmware is necessary to using the board with OpenOCD.
A good step by step guide is available
[here](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Firmware-FRDM-K64F).

## I can't flash the device with OpenOCD anymore...
When a flash process has failed or a wrong firmware has been programmed, the
following OpenOCD message may appear:
```
START...

```
Solution 1:
+ Hold the reset button and execute make BOARD=frdm-k64f flash in a project
directory
+ Release reset button just after "Info : MDM: Chip is unsecured.
Continuing."

Solution 2:
+ Comment out line `reset_config srst_only srst_nogate connect_assert_srst`
in `boards/frdm-k64f/dist/openocd.cfg`
+ Execute make BOARD=frdm-k64f flash in a project directory

Solution 3:
+ Ask Deep Thought
