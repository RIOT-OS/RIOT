### Flash the board

See the **Flashing** section in @ref boards_common_nrf52. The easiest way is to
use an external Segger J-Link Progammer connected to the [SWD Connector].

### Terminal
To connect a terminal to the Feather, RIOT chooses Segger RTT per default.
This lets you use the Segger J-Link Programmer as a serial interface to the
device.

You have several alternative possibilities to connect to the board.

1. With
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.mk}
   USEMODULE += stdio_uart
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   and an FTDI adapter connected to the Feather's RX and TX ports you can use
   UART-based terminals to connect to the feather
2. With
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.mk}
   USEMODULE += stdio_cdc_acm
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   you can access the Feather with a terminal directly over USB.
