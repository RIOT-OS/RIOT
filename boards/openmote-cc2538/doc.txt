@brief       Support for the OpenMote-cc2538 board

## Overview

The [OpenMote](http://www.openmote.com/) is slim board that comes with a TI
SoC combining an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller with an IEEE802.15.4 radio.

The OpenMote can be used with an "OpenBase" which provides an RJ-45, 2 x USB
mini ports, a JTAG header,  and two pin headers which provide access to the
microprocessor pins. For example, the pins labelled DOUT/DIN provide access to
the UART Tx/Rx respectively. This UART is connected to the "USB_FTDI" port via
an FTDI FT232RQ UART/USB driver chip.

##  Flashing and Debugging

Currently RIOT supports flashing the OpenMote using a Segger JLink JTAG
adapter or via USB, using the bootloader on the board.

### Flashing via USB

To flash via USB, connect the "ON/SLEEP" pin to ground, and reset the board
into the bootloader by pressing the reset button ("BUT1"). Then call "make
flash" from your application directory.

### Flashing via JTAG

To be able to flash the board via JTAG you need to install Seggers JLinkExe
tool. Once you have this in place, you can simply flash by calling

`make flash`

from your application folder.

Mac OS users may experiment a command line expecting `connect`. Just type it
and the process will continue.
