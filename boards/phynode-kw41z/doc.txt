@brief       Support for the Phytec PhyNODE KW41Z Board

### Overview

The [Phytec PhyNODE-KW41Z][board-web-page] board is a development platform based
on the PhyWAVE-KW41z wireless module (populated with NXP Semiconductor Kinetis
KW41Z microcontroller).

It provides a radio device with Bluetooth Low Energy and/or IEEE
802.15.4.

There's also available an HDL1010 High Accuracy Digital Humidity sensor, a
CCS811 IAQ gas sensor, a MMA8652FC accelerometer and a TCS37727 RGB Light
sensor.

There board also provides an SSD1673 Active Matrix EPD 150x200 Display Driver
 with Controller on board.

### Flash the board

To flash the board using OpenOCD:

1. Use `BOARD=phynode-kw41z` with the `make` command.<br/>
   Example with `hello-world` application:
```
     make BOARD=phynode-kw41z -C examples/basic/hello-world flash term
```

### Current support

The TCS37727 RGB Light sensor, the MMA8652FC accelerometer and the CCS811
digital gas sensor are supported. There's ongoing work on
[IEEE802.15.4 radio support for KW41Z][radio-support]
