## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

The ST Nucleo-F302R8 board includes an on-board ST-LINK V2-1 programmer.
The easiest way to program the board is to use OpenOCD. Once you have
installed OpenOCD (look [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD)
for installation instructions), you can flash the board simply by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-f302r8 flash
```
and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-f302r8 debug
```
### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-f302r8 PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

## Supported Toolchains
For using the ST Nucleo-F302R8 board we strongly recommend the usage of
the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain.
