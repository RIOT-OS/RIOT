@brief       Support for running RIOT in native32

[Family: native](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-native)

Same board as \ref boards_native "native", but compiled for 32-bit instead of 64-bit.
Currently only Linux x86 and ARM32 are supported.
Otherwise, everything works the same as for the 64-bit version.
For more information on this board, see the \ref boards_native "native board" documentation.
