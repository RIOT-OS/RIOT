## Flashing the device

Connect the device to your Micro-USB cable using the port labeled as *DEBUG
USB*.

The standard method for flashing RIOT to the same54-xpro is using [edbg](https://github.com/ataradov/edbg).
by calling: `make BOARD=same54-xpro -C tests/leds flash`

Note that on Linux, you will need libudev-dev package to be installed.

Users can also use openOCD to flash and/or debug the board using:
`PROGRAMMER=openocd make BOARD=same54-xpro -C tests/leds flash`


On Linux you will have to add a **udev** rule for hidraw, like
```
bash
echo 'KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"' \
    | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb.rules
sudo service udev restart
```
