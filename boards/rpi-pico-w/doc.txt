 * @brief       Support for the RP2040 based Raspberry Pi Pico W board
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * The Raspberry Pi Pico W and Pico WH (with headers) is a board with RP2040 MCU,
 * a custom dual core ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU with relatively high CPU clock, plenty of
 * RAM, some unique peripheral (the Programmable IO) and the Infineon CYW43439 wireless
 * chip.
 *
 * ## Hardware
 *
 * @image html https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/pico-w.png "Raspberry Pi Pico W" width=50%
 *
 * Raspberry Pi Pico W is provided in two versions - without and with headers,
 * the second one is called Pico WH. Detailed photos can be found at [Raspberry Pi Pico family](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/four_picos.jpg).
 *
 * ### MCU
 *
 * The Programmable IO (PIO) peripheral and the SSI/QSPI peripheral that supports execution from
 * flash (XIP) are the most distinguishing features of the MCU. The latter is especially important,
 * since the RP2040 contains no internal flash.

 *
 * (*) Currently not implemented in the RIOT OS.
 *
 * ### User Interface
 *
 * 1 button (also used for boot selection) and 1 LED:
 *
 * | Device | PIN              |
 * |:------ |:---------------- |
 * | LED0   | WL_GPIO0  (*)    |
 * | SW0    | QSPI_SS_N (**)   |
 *
 * (*) In the Pico W LED0 is directly connected to the Infineon CYW43439 module,
 * and cannot be directly controlled by MCU.
 *
 * (**) Since the switch is connected to the chip-select pin of the QSPI interface the flash chip RIOT
 * is running from via XIP, the switch is difficult to read out from software. This is currently not
 * supported.
 *
 * ### Pinout

 *
 * ## Flashing the Board
 *
 * ### Flashing the Board Using the Bootloader
 *
 * Connect the device to your Micro-USB cable while the button (labeled `BOOTSEL`
 * on the silkscreen of the PCB) is pressed to enter the bootloader. The pico
 * will present itself as a storage medium to the system, to which a UF2 file
 * can be copied perform the flashing of the device. This can be automated by
 * running:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=rpi-pico-w flash
 * ```
 *
 * This is default flashing option using picotool PROGRAMMER.
 *
 * ### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD
 *
 * Currently (June 2021), only two methods for debugging via OpenOCD are supported:
 *
 * 1. Using a bit-banging low-level adapter, e.g. via the GPIOs of a Raspberry Pi 4B
 * 2. Using a virtual CMSIS-DAP adapter provided by the second CPU core via
 *    https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug
 *
 * Option 2 requires no additional hardware however, you need to
 * first "flash" the gimme-cache variant of [pico-debug](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug)
 * into RAM using the UF2 bootloader. For this, plug in the USB cable while holding down the BOOTSEL
 * button of the Pico and copy the `pico-debug-gimmecache.uf2` from the
 * [latest pico-debug release](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug/releases) into the virtual FAT
 * formatted drive the bootloader provides. Once this drive is unmounted again, this will result in
 * the Raspberry Pi Pico showing up as CMSIS-DAP debugger. Afterwards run:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=rpi-pico-w PROGRAMMER=openocd flash
 * ```
 *
 * @warning    The `rpi-pico-w` virtual debugger is not persistent and needs to be "flashed" into RAM
 *             again after each cold boot.
 *
 * @note       The RP2040 MCU is supported from OpenOCD version 0.12.0 onwards.
 *
 * ### Flashing the Board Using J-Link
 *
 * Connect the Board to an Segger J-Link debugger, e.g. the EDU mini debugger is relatively affordable,
 * but limited to educational purposes. Afterwards run:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=rpi-pico-w PROGRAMMER=jlink flash
 * ```
 *
 * ## Accessing RIOT shell
 *
 * This board's default access to RIOT shell is via UART (UART0 TX - pin 1, UART0 RX - pin 2).
 *
 * The default baud rate is 115 200.
 *
 * The simplest way to connect to the shell is the execution of the command:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=rpi-pico-w term
 * ```
 *
 * @warning Raspberry Pi Pico board is not 5V tolerant. Use voltage divider or logic level shifter when connecting to 5V UART.
 *
 * ## On-Chip Debugging
 *
 * There are currently (June 2021) few hardware options for debugging the Raspberry Pi Pico:
 *
 * 1. Via J-Link using one of Seggers debuggers
 * 2. Via OpenOCD using a low-level bit-banging debugger (e.g. a Raspberry Pi 4B with the GPIOs
 *    connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico via jump wires)
 * 3. Via a recently updated [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic)
 *
 * In addition, a software-only option is possible using
 * [pico-debug](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-debug). The default linker script reserved 16 KiB of
 * RAM for this debugger, hence just "flash" the "gimme-cache" flavor into RAM using the UF2
 * bootloader. Once this is done, debugging is as simple as running:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=rpi-pico-w debug
 * ```
 *
 * ***Beware:*** The `rpi-pico-w` virtual debugger is not persistent and needs to be "flashed"
 * into RAM again after each cold boot. The initialization code of RIOT now seems to play well with the
 * debugger, so it remains persistent on soft reboots. If you face issues with losing connection to
 * the debugger on reboot, try `monitor reset init` in GDB to soft-reboot instead.
 *
 * ## Known Issues / Problems
 *
 * ### Early State Implementation
 *
 * Currently no support for the following peripherals is implemented:
 *
 * - USB
 * - RTC
 * - Watchdog
 * - SMP support (multi CPU support is not implemented in RIOT)
 * - Infineon CYW 43439 wireless chip
 *
 * The I2C peripheral is implemented through the PIO.
