 * @brief       Support for the STM32G0316-DISCO board.
 *
 * ### General information
 *
 * The ST [STM32G0316-DISCO](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32g0316-disco.html)
 * is an evaluation board supporting a ARM Cortex-M0 STM32G031J6 microcontroller
 * with 8KB of RAM and 32KB of ROM Flash.
 *
 * ### Pinout
 *
 * In an SO8 package, this MCU uses multi-bonding to run multiple ports to the same pins.
 * See [this application note as reference](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00443870-getting-started-with-stm32g0-series-hardware-development-stmicroelectronics.pdf).
 * This means the responsibility is on the firmware configurer to take special care when configured IO, ensuring that
 * ports are not conflicting on each pin.
 *
 * ### Flash the board
 *
 * The STM32G0316-DISCO board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
 * flashed using OpenOCD.
 *
 * To flash this board, just use the following command:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=stm32g0316-disco flash -C examples/hello-world
 * ```
 *
 * ### UART Terminal Interaction
 *
 * Due to the limited number of pins, to get stdio UART traffic, use a USB->UART adapter
 * like the CP2104 from Adafruit (http://adafru.it/954).  Connect the adapter's TX line
 * to the MCU RX pin (PB6, Pin 8) and the adapter's RX line to the MCU's TX pin -
 * (PB7, pin 1)
