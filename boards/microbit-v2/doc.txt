@brief       Support for the BBC micro:bit v2

## Overview

The [micro:bit v2](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) was designed by the BBC and
released in 2020.

The board is based on the Nordic nRF52833 SoC, featuring 128KiB of RAM, 512KiB
of ROM, and a 2.4GHz radio, that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), 802.15.4
as well as a Nordic proprietary radio mode.

Additionally the boards features 2 buttons, a 5x5 LED matrix, a speaker, a
microphone, an accelerometer and a magnetometer.

##  Flashing and Debugging

The board can be flashed using OpenOCD and PyOCD. Debugger is also available
with both programmers.

```
BOARD=microbit make flash
```

## STDIO

The programmer chip provides access to STDIO via USB. On Linux, stdio is
usually available on /dev/ttyACM0. Use the `term` target to access stdio:

```
BOARD=microbit make term
```

## Display

The 5x5 LED matrix display can be driven using the @ref boards_common_microbit.

## Button setup

The Microbit logo and the rings are configured in resistive mode, and expressed
as buttons by default when SAUL is enabled (through @ref saul_gpio_params_t).
Note that to press them, you have to touch the GND pin at the same time, and
may need to press hard if you have dry fingers.  See [the micro:bit documentation on touch]
for more information. Capacitive mode is currently not supported.
