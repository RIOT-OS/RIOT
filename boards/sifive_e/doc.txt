 * @brief       Support for the QEmu sifive_e RISC-V board
 * @author      Koen Zandberg <koen@bergzand.net>

The Qemu sifive_e 'board' is an emulated RISC-V machine supported by Qemu from
release v2.12.0. Supported is UART stdio and the RISC-V core internal timer.

Binaries for the hifive1 board are mostly compatible. The exception is the
timer. On sifive_e it runs at 10 MHz.

## Usage

Compile as usual:
```
make -C examples/hello-world BOARD=sifive_e
```

Start and run with Qemu with the `emulate` target:

```
make -C examples/hello-world BOARD=sifive_e emulate
```

## Known issues

A Qemu-supplied warning noting that time_lo and time_hi are not implemented
can appear when using the hardware timer:

```
qemu-system-riscv32: clint: time_lo write not implemented
qemu-system-riscv32: clint: time_hi write not implemented
```

RIOT resets the mtime register when initializing the timer. Qemu however
doesn't implement writes to this register and throws a warning instead. This
doesn't negatively impact RIOT as long as the firmware doesn't rely on an
absolute value returned by `timer_read()`.
