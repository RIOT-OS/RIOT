@brief       Support for the limifrog-v1 board

## Overview
LimiFrog-v1 arose from the La BlueFrog board. LimiFrog-v1 contains the first
hardware revision of that kickstarter project. LimiFrog-v2 is already there and
the RIOT support will follow. [LimiFrog](http://www.limifrog.io/home-en-
kickstarter/) features a variety of sensors as well as an OLED Display and a BLE
(Bluetooth Low-Energy) module.

## Flashing and Debugging the device

The LimiFrog-v1 has no on-board programmer nor an USB-UART converter. It can
be programmed by using the integrated ST-Link/V2 programmer of any STM32Fx-
discovery board. See Hardware section [here](@ref boards_yunjia-nrf51822) for an example.
Another way is to use a stand-alone ST-Link V2 programmer as shown in the
picture.

To debug the device you may also want to use a stand-alone UART converter and
connect it to the pins PC10 and PC11 and keep the programmer plugged.
