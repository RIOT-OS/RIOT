 * @brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-L4R5ZI

## Overview

The Nucleo-L4R5ZI is a board from ST's Nucleo family supporting a ARM Cortex-M4
STM32L4R5ZI microcontroller with 640Kb of RAM and 2Mb of ROM Flash.

## Flashing the device

The ST Nucleo-L4R5ZI board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.
@note The latest release of OpenOCD doesn't contain support for this board,
so a recent development version (including  http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/4777)
must be built from source to be able to flash this board.

To flash this board, just use the following command:

```
make BOARD=nucleo-l4r5zi flash -C examples/hello-world
```

### STDIO

STDIO is available via the ST-Link programmer.

Use the `term` target to open a terminal:

    make BOARD=nucleo-l4r5zi -C examples/hello-world term
