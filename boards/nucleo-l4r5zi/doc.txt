## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

The ST Nucleo-L4R5ZI board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.
@note The latest release of OpenOCD doesn't contain support for this board,
so a recent development version (including  http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/4777)
must be built from source to be able to flash this board.

To flash this board, just use the following command:

```
make BOARD=nucleo-l4r5zi flash -C examples/hello-world
```

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l4r5zi PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

## Accessing RIOT shell

Default RIOT shell access utilize VCP (Virtual COM Port) via USB interface,
provided by integrated ST-LINK programmer. ST-LINK is connected to the
microcontroller LPUART1.

The default baud rate is 115 200.

Use the `term` target to open a terminal:

    make BOARD=nucleo-l4r5zi -C examples/hello-world term
