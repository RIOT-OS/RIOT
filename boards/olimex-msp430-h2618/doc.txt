@warning    While erasing or writing to the flash, the MCU must be powered by
            at least 2.2 V

## Schematics

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maribu/images/master/Olimex%20MSP430-H2618%20Schematic.svg" alt="Schematics of the Olimex MSP430-H2618 Board" style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;">

## Pinout

The 64 pins on the edges of the PCB are connected to the corresponding MCU pins.
Hence, the following pinout of the naked MSP430-F2618 MCU chip matches the
pinout of the header board:

## Flashing RIOT

<img src="https://github.com/maribu/images/raw/master/Olimex%20MSP430-H2618%20with%20Debugger.jpeg" alt="Photo of Olimex MSP430-H2618 Board connected to a JTAG Debugger" style="width: 512px; max-width: 100%;">

Connect the board to a JTAG debugger supported by
[mspdebug](https://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/); by default the
Olimex MSP430-JTAG-Tiny (as shown in the picture above) is assumed, which is
among the less expensive options.

@note       If you are not using the Olimex MSP430-JTAG-Tiny (or a compatible
            programmer), set `MSPDEBUG_PROGRAMMER` to the correct value via
            an environment variable or as parameter to make. E.g. use
            `make BOARD=olimex-msp430-h2618 MSPDEBUG_PROGRAMMER=bus-pirate` to
            flash using the bus pirate.

@warning    You can power the board via the JTAG programmer by placing a
            jumper at `P_IN`. However, the JTAG programmer will only be able
            to provide a limited current. You may want to disconnect the
            header board from devices consuming a lot of power prior to
            flashing.

@warning    If the board is powered externally, make sure to place the jumper
            in `P_OUT` position, not in `P_IN` position.

@warning    A jumper in `P_OUT` is mutually exclusive to a jumper in `P_IN`.
            Never connect both at the same time.

@note       Pin 1 on the JTAG connector has a small white triangle next to it
            and square pad, compared to the round pad used by all other JTAG
            pins.

@warning    The Olimex MSP430-JTAG-Tiny will fail to flash or debug the board
            until the latest firmware is installed. For that, install the
            Windows-only programmer software and update the DLLs files to
            contain the latest firmware as described in the website. The
            software will update the programmer upon launch.

Once the jumper is correctly placed in either `P_IN` or in `P_OUT` and the
JTAG cable is connected just run

```
make BOARD=olimex-msp430-h2618 flash
```

## Using the shell

stdio is available via the UART interface with `TXD = P3.6`
(pin 35 on the header) and `RXD = P3.7` (pin 34 on the header) at 115,200 Baud.

The easiest way is to connect an USB TTL adapter (such as the cheap `cp210x`
or `ch341` based adapters) as follows:

```
TTL adapter    Olimex MSP430-H2618
-----------    -------------------

       GND --- 63 (DV_SS)
       TXD --- 35 (P3.7)
       RXD --- 34 (P3.6)
```
