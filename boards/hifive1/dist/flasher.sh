#
# Former Unified OpenOCD script for RIOT..
# This has been modified to not do "reset" or "reset run" commands while
# flashing since the HiFive1 does not support them.
#
# This script is supposed to be called from RIOTs make system,
# as it depends on certain environment variables. An OpenOCD
# configuration file must be present in a the boards dist folder.
#
# Any extra command line arguments after the command name are passed on the
# openocd command line after the configuration file name but before any other
# initialization commands.
#
# Global environment variables used:
# OPENOCD:             OpenOCD command name, default: "openocd"
# OPENOCD_CONFIG:      OpenOCD configuration file name,
#                      default: "${RIOTBOARD}/${BOARD}/dist/openocd.cfg"
#
# The script supports the following actions:
#
# flash:        flash <image_file>
#               flash given file to the target.
#
#               options:
#               <image_file>:   Filename of the file that will be flashed
#               PRE_FLASH_CHECK_SCRIPT: a command to run before flashing to
#               verify the integrity of the image to be flashed. <image_file> is
#               passed as a command line argument to this command.
#
#               Flashing works with any file format recognized by OpenOCD
#               (elf, ihex, s19, bin).

# Default OpenOCD command
: ${OPENOCD:=openocd}
# This is an optional offset to the base address that can be used to flash an
# image in a different location than it is linked at. This feature can be useful
# when flashing images for firmware swapping/remapping boot loaders.
# Default offset is 0, meaning the image will be flashed at the address that it
# was linked at.
: ${IMAGE_OFFSET:=0}
# Type of image, leave empty to let OpenOCD automatically detect the type from
# the file (default).
# Valid values: elf, hex, s19, bin (see OpenOCD manual for more information)
