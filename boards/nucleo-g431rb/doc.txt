@brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-G431RB

## Flashing the device

The ST Nucleo-G431RB board includes an on-board ST-LINK V3 programmer. The
easiest way to program the board is to use OpenOCD. Once you have installed
OpenOCD (look [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD) for
installation instructions), you can flash the board simply by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-g431rb flash
```
and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-g431rb debug
```

## Supported Toolchains

For using the ST Nucleo-G431RB board we recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.
