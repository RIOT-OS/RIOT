### Flash the board

The board is flashed using its on-board
[boot loader](https://github.com/adafruit/uf2-samdx1).

The process is automated in the usual `make flash` target.

If RIOT is already running on the board, it will automatically reset the CPU
and enter the bootloader. If some other firmware is running or RIOT crashed,
you need to enter the bootloader manually by double tapping the board's reset
button.

Readiness of the bootloader is indicated by LED pulsing in red.

### Accessing STDIO

The usual way to obtain a console on this board is using an emulated USB serial
port.
