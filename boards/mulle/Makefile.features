### CPU part number (must have a specific linker script for each part)
# Note that MK60DN256ZVLL10 (version 1.x) and MK60DN256VLL10 (version 2.x, no Z)
# only differ in some register locations etc, not in the actual memory layout,
# so it is safe to use the same linker script for both version 1.x and version
# 2.x silicon.
# The linker script needs to know the flash and RAM sizes of the device.
