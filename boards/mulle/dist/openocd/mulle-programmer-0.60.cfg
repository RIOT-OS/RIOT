# Mulle programmer board v0.60

# The Mulle programming board uses a FTDI FT2232H chip for USB UART and JTAG
# combined functionality.

# These are the pins that are used for SRST and TRST. Note that the Mulle
# programming board inverts the reset signal between the FTDI chip and the MCU,
# so we need to use -ndata here to tell OpenOCD that the signals are active HIGH.

# In the eyes of OpenOCD, the reset signal is push-pull, because of the hardware
# design however, it is actually open drain.
