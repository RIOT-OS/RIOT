# Mulle programming board.

# In the eyes of OpenOCD, the reset signal is push-pull, because of the hardware
# design however, it is actually open drain.
# The trst pin can only be used if the MCU has been configured by setting the
# correct pin multiplexing function on the TRST pin (PTA5).
# If you have configured the TRST pin correctly you can change srst_only to
# trst_and_srst
