### Flash the board

1. Put the board in bootloader mode by double tapping the reset button.<br/>
   When the board is in bootloader mode, the user led (green) oscillates
   smoothly.


2. Use `BOARD=arduino-mkrfox1200` with the `make` command.<br/>
   Example with `hello-world` application:
```
     make BOARD=arduino-mkrfox1200 -C examples/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

To access the STDIO of RIOT, a FTDI to USB converter needs to be plugged to
the RX/TX pins on the board.
