### Schematics

The board detailed description and schematic is available
[here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-CLUE-PCB).

### Flash the board

The board is flashed using the `adafruit-nrfutil` Python package:
```
    $ pip install --user adafruit-nrfutil
```

Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=adafruit-clue -C examples/essentials/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port. On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=adafruit-clue -C examples/essentials/hello-world term
```

The `TERM_DELAY` environment variable can be used to add a delay (in second)
before opening the serial terminal. The default value is 2s which should be
enough in most of the situations.
