## Flashing the device
The STM32F030F4 Demo Board board does not include a programmer.
You have to connect a separate ST-Link programmer to the (SW)DIO, (SW)CLK, GND and
NRST pins on the board.

If you want a serial terminal, you have to connect a separate USB-Serial adapter to
the RX and TX pins on the board.

The easiest way to program the board is to use OpenOCD. Once you have installed
OpenOCD (look [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD) for
installation instructions), you can flash the board simply by typing

```
make BOARD=stm32f030f4-demo flash
```
and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=stm32f030f4-demo debug
```
