@brief       Support for the Atmel SAM L21 Xplained Pro board.

## Overview

The `SAML21 Xplained Pro` is an ultra-low power evaluation board by Atmel
featuring a ATSAML21J18A SoC. The SoC includes a SAML21 ARM Cortex-M0+ micro-
controller. For programming the MCU comes with 32Kb of RAM and 256Kb of flash
memory.

The saml21-xpro is available from various hardware vendors for ~50USD (as of
oct. 2015).

*Please note:*  ATMEL's most recent SAML21s are the `B` variant, or
`ATSAML21J18B`.  Because the driver changes are mostly small, throughout this
reference the device will continue to be referred to as the `ATSAML21J18[A/B]`
indiscriminately;

## Flashing the device

Connect the device to your Micro-USB cable using the port labeled as *EDBG*.

The standard method for flashing RIOT to the saml21-xpro is using [edbg](https://github.com/ataradov/edbg).
by calling: `make BOARD=saml21-xpro -C tests/leds flash`

Note that on Linux, you will need libudev-dev package to be installed.

Users can also use openOCD to flash and/or debug the board using:
`PROGRAMMER=openocd make BOARD=saml21-xpro -C tests/leds flash`

On Linux you will have to add a **udev** rule for hidraw, like
```
bash
echo 'KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"' \
    | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb.rules
sudo service udev restart
```

### Arch Linux
With yaourt:
```
yaourt -S libudev0
yaourt -S hidapi-git
yaourt -S openocd-git
# edit PKGBUILD, add "cmsis-dap hidapi-libusb" to "_features"
```

### Ubuntu
Although this refers to setting up the SAMR21, this guide is still very
helpful to understanding how to set up a solid RIOT development environment for
the SAML21: http://watr.li/samr21-dev-setup-ubuntu.html
