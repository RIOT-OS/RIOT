@brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-L073RZ


## Overview

The Nucleo-L073RZ is a board from ST's Nucleo family supporting ARM Cortex-M0
STM32L073RZT6 microcontroller with 20KiB of RAM and 192KiB of Flash.

## Pinout

## Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l073rz PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
      can be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).
