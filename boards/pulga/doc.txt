@brief       Support for the Pulga board


### RESET pin configuration

See nrf52840dk's configuration.

## Flash the board

See the `Flashing` section in @ref boards_common_nrf52.

## Accessing STDIO via UART

Currently requires an external adapter, such as those
based on the cp2102, which on a Linux host is generally
accessible via `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=pulga -C examples/hello-world term
```
