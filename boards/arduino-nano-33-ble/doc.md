### Flash the board

Use `BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble -C examples/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port. On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble -C examples/hello-world term
```
