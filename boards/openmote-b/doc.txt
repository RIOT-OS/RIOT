## Overview

The [OpenMote](http://www.openmote.com/) is slim board that comes with a TI
SoC combining an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller with an IEEE802.15.4 radio.

##  Flashing and Debugging

Currently RIOT supports flashing the OpenMote using a Segger JLink JTAG
adapter or via USB, using the bootloader on the board.

### Flashing via USB

RIOT support flashing with USB by default.

`make flash`

You may have to specify the flashing port with
`PORT_BSL=<my_openmote_port> make flash`

@note       On some boards the MSP430 chip responsible for controlling
the bootloading pins may not be functioning.  If you are only able to flash
when there is no image (either the first time after purchase or after erasing
with the jtag).  Please contact the manufacturer to provide a fix.

### Flashing via JTAG

To be able to flash the board via JTAG you need to install Seggers JLinkExe
tool. Once you have this in place, you can simply flash by calling

`PROGRAMMER=jlink make flash`

from your application folder.

Mac OS users may experiment a command line expecting `connect`. Just type it
and the process will continue.
