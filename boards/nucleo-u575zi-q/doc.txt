## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

The ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.

Once OpenOCD is installed, you can flash the board simply by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-u575zi-q flash
```

and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-u575zi-q debug
```

## Accessing RIOT shell

Default RIOT shell access utilize VCP (Virtual COM Port) via USB interface,
provided by integrated ST-LINK programmer. ST-LINK is connected to the
microcontroller USART1.

The default baud rate is 115 200.

If a physical connection to USART1 is needed, connect UART interface to pins PA9 (USART1 TX) and PA10 (USART1 RX).
