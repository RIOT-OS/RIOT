@brief       Support for the STM32 B-U585I-IOT02A

## Flashing the device

The ST B-U585I-IOT02A board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.
@note The latest release (v0.11) of OpenOCD doesn't contain yet support for this board,
so the source code version from upstream master must be cloned and built:

```
$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
$ cd openocd
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=<installation directory>
$ make -j
$ sudo make install
```

Once the patched OpenOCD is built and installed, you can flash the board simply
by typing

```
make BOARD=b-u585i-iot02a flash
```

and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=b-u585i-iot02a debug
```

## Supported Toolchains

For using the ST B-U585I-IOT02A board we recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.

**Important notice:** With GCC 10, the `tests/malloc` application doesn't work.
To use malloc, prefer GCC 9 which seems to work better.
