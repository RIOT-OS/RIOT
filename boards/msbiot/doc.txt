# Hardware

### MCU

The centerpiece of the MSB-IoT is the STM32F415RG MCU. With a maximum
frequency of 168 MHz it offers high performance for a microcontroller of its
category. The STM32F415RG comes with a huge set of accessible communication
interfaces and features that are listed [here](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1577/LN1035/PF252143?sc=internet/mcu/product/252143.jsp).

Due to licensing issues, RIOT's driver implementations for the STM32F4 series
are not based on ST's standard peripheral library. Therefore, not every feature
of the MCU is currently supported in RIOT.

For an overview on the currently supported functional units please check the
following directories:
* [Peripheral implementations](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/cpu/stm32f4/periph) and corresponding
[Interfaces](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/drivers/include/periph)
* Main [STM32F4 directory](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/cpu/stm32f4)
 and [Cortex M4 directory](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/cpu/cortex-m4_common)

### RIOT pin mapping

The following picture shows the easily accessible pins of the board:
![MSB-IoT Pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RIOT-OS/RIOT/images/msbiot-pinout.png)

RIOT uses its own naming scheme for GPIO pins and other functionality. The
actual STM32F4 specific pins and functional units are mapped to RIOT internal
enum values. Please refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RLn1j5h7VIQ1zezRs5Z3A7SYCMvEukHaKjhcsyrDz6g/pubhtml)
for RIOTs pin mapping
for the MSB-IoT (the document only lists ports where a PIN is mapped).

The pin mapping can be altered freely by editing the
`boards/msbiot/include/periph_conf.h` header file found
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/boards/msbiot/include).
Please keep in mind that changing pin mappings that are important for the
integrated hardware could affect the corresponding driver implementations. The
most important mappings needed for correct operation of the MSB-IoT with RIOT
can be extracted from the `boards/msbiot/include/board.h` found
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/boards/msbiot/include).

### User Interface

**3 Buttons:**

| NAME   | User Button T1    | User Button T2    | T RESET|
|:----- |:----- |:--------- |:------|
| Pin    | PB13 | PA0    | NRST|
The user buttons are mapped to GPIO_0 (Button T2) and GPIO_8 (Button T1) in
the board's default configuration file for RIOT. To configure and use the
buttons, you can use the provided interface functions from RIOT's
[GPIO](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/drivers/include/periph/gpio.h) low-level driver interface.

Pushing the reset button will always reset the board and restart your
application.

**3 user controllable LEDs:**

| NAME  | LED_RED   | LED_YELLOW | LED_GREEN |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Color | red       | yellow     | green     |
| Pin   | PB8       | PB14       | PB15      |
The LEDs can be controlled inside your RIOT application by using the LED
macros provided [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/boards/msbiot/include/board.h).

There is also a yellow charge LED on the board indicating the charging
process of the battery.

**1 Beeper:**

| NAME | Beeper |
|:----- |:----- |
| Pin    | PB09 |
The board's beeper allows for acoustic feedback. It needs a PWM signal
between 1-5 kHz and is mapped to GPIO_5 and PWM_0 in RIOT. To configure and use
the beeper inside your application, you can use the provided interface functions
from RIOT's [GPIO](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/drivers/include/periph/gpio.h) and
[PWM](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/drivers/include/periph/pwm.h)
low-level driver interfaces.


### CC1101 Sub-1GHz RF Transceiver

The board has an integrated CC1101 Sub-1GHz RF Transceiver which is connected
to the MCU using the SPI. The transceiver allows for energy-efficient local
communication in the frequency band below 1 GHz. The CC1101 is configured as the
`defaulttransceiver` for the MSB-IoT in RIOT (see
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/boards/msbiot/Makefile.include)) and the necessary driver
files are automatically included for applications that use the
`defaulttransceiver` module.

### CC3000 802.11b/g Wi-Fi Module
In addition to the CC1101, the MSB-IoT also features a CC3000 Wi-Fi Module.
The CC3000 is a self-contained wireless network module with a full embedded IPv4
TCP/IP stack that for example allows to use the MSB-IoT as a gateway node to the
internet. Please note that the CC3000 only supports operation in infrastructure
mode and therefore always needs to be connected to an access point to be used
for communication.

The CC3000's driver implementation for RIOT includes the full driver provided
by Texas Instruments. The API documentation from TI can be found
[here](http://software-dl.ti.com/ecs/simplelink/cc3000/public/doxygen_API/v1.14/html/index.html). To
use the CC3000 in RIOT, just add `USEMODULE += cc3000` to your application's
Makefile.

The driver for the CC3000 is not yet merged into RIOT's master branch. Please
see pull request [#2603](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/2603) for progress
on the inclusion.

### MPU-9150 Nine-Axis MotionTracking Device
The MSB-IoT is equipped with a MPU-9150 MotionTracking Device from
Invensense. The device combines a gyroscope, a magnetometer and an accelerometer
in one module.

Due to licensing issues, the current MPU-9150 driver implementation for RIOT
is not based on Invensense's 'Motion Driver' library and offers only a limited
set of features. Nonetheless, the RIOT driver allows to configure and read
values from all three sensors of the device. For an overview on the supported
features, you can check the [driver's interface](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/drivers/include/mpu9150.h).

A sample RIOT application for the MPU-9150 that utilizes the driver can be
found [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/tests/driver_mpu9150).

| Product    | MPU-9150      |

### Other components
For the following components of the MSB-IoT, there is currently no support in
RIOT:
* [TCA6416 16-Bit I/O Expander](http://www.ti.com/product/tca6416)
* Micro-SD-Card Interface

# Compiling, Flashing and Debugging
This section only covers the automated functionality provided by RIOT's
makefile system. If you don't want to rely on RIOT's make targets for flashing
or debugging (for instance to use a different flashing tool), please check the
documentation of your used tools.

### Prerequisites
We strongly recommend the usage of the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain for the MSB-IoT.
Support for other toolchains was not tested!

RIOT's provided functionality for debugging and flashing the MSB-IoT is based
on the [Open On-Chip Debugger](http://openocd.org/) tool. A wiki page with
installation instructions and some other information can be found
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD).

### Quick start
For a quick getting started guide you can stick to the steps explained on
[this page](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Getting-started-with-STM32F%5B0%7C3%7C4%5Ddiscovery-boards). Just make sure to use "msbiot" as the
respective board name.

### Using the UART for STDIO
The MCU's USART2 is set as the default input/output for the MSB-IoT inside
RIOT (mapped to UART_0). It is initialized and configured automatically for
every RIOT application and can be used for communication with your computer. The
easiest way is to use an USB to TTL adapter:

Step 1: Connect your adapter and the boards pin strip with RX<=>PA02,
TX<=>PA03 and GND<=>GND

Step 2: Done. The MCUs USART2 is used as STDIO.
