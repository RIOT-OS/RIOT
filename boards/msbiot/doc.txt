# Hardware


### MCU

The centerpiece of the MSB-IoT is the STM32F415RG MCU. With a maximum
frequency of 168 MHz it offers high performance for a microcontroller of its
category. The STM32F415RG comes with a huge set of accessible communication
interfaces and features that are listed [here](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1577/LN1035/PF252143?sc=internet/mcu/product/252143.jsp).

### GPIO Pins

The following picture shows the easily accessible pins of the board:

![MSB-IoT Pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/RIOT-OS/RIOT/images/msbiot-pinout.png)

### User Interface

#### 3 Buttons

| NAME  | User Button T1    | User Button T2    | T RESET   |
|:----- |:----------------- |:----------------- |:--------- |
| Pin   | PB13              | PA0               | NRST      |

The user buttons are mapped to GPIO_0 (Button T2) and GPIO_8 (Button T1) in
the board's default configuration file for RIOT. To configure and use the
buttons, you can use RIOT's @ref drivers_periph_gpio.

Pushing the reset button will always reset the board and restart your
application.

#### 3 user controllable LEDs

| NAME      | LED_RED           | LED_YELLOW        | LED_GREEN         |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Color     | red               | yellow            | green             |
| Pin       | PB8               | PB14              | PB15              |
| Pin Alias | @ref LED0_PIN     | @ref LED1_PIN     | @ref LED2_PIN     |
| Macros    | @ref LED0_ON, ... | @ref LED1_ON, ... | @ref LED2_ON, ... |

The LEDs can be controlled inside your RIOT application by using the LED
macros @ref LED0_ON, @ref LED0_OFF, and @ref LED0_TOGGLE for the red LED,
@ref LED1_ON, @ref LED1_OFF, and @ref LED1_TOGGLE for the yellow LED, and
@ref LED2_ON, @ref LED2_OFF, and @ref LED2_TOGGLE for the green LED.

There is also a yellow charge LED on the board indicating the charging
process of the battery.

#### 1 Beeper

| NAME  | Beeper    |
|:----- |:--------- |
| Pin   | PB09      |

The board's beeper allows for acoustic feedback. It needs a PWM signal
between 1-5 kHz and is connected to pin PB9 and mapped to PWM_0 in RIOT. To
configure and use the beeper inside your application, you can use RIOT's
@ref drivers_periph_pwm.


### CC1101 Sub-1GHz RF Transceiver

The board has an integrated CC1101 Sub-1GHz RF Transceiver which is connected
to the MCU using the SPI. The transceiver allows for energy-efficient local
communication in the frequency band below 1 GHz. The driver for the CC1101
automatically loaded when the pseudo module `netdev_default` is used.

### CC3000 802.11b/g Wi-Fi Module

In addition to the CC1101, the MSB-IoT also features a CC3000 Wi-Fi Module.
The CC3000 is a self-contained wireless network module with a full embedded IPv4
TCP/IP stack that for example allows to use the MSB-IoT as a gateway node to the
internet. Please note that the CC3000 only supports operation in infrastructure
mode and therefore always needs to be connected to an access point to be used
for communication.

The CC3000's driver implementation for RIOT includes the full driver provided
by Texas Instruments. The API documentation from TI can be found
[here](http://software-dl.ti.com/ecs/simplelink/cc3000/public/doxygen_API/v1.14/html/index.html). To
use the CC3000 in RIOT, just add `USEMODULE += cc3000` to your application's
Makefile.

The driver for the CC3000 is not yet merged into RIOT's master branch. Please
see pull request [#2603](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/2603) for progress
on the inclusion.

### MPU-9150 Nine-Axis MotionTracking Device

The MSB-IoT is equipped with a MPU-9150 MotionTracking Device from
Invensense. The device combines a gyroscope, a magnetometer and an accelerometer
in one module.

Due to licensing issues, the current MPU-9150 driver implementation for RIOT
is not based on Invensense's 'Motion Driver' library and offers only a limited
set of features. Nonetheless, the RIOT driver allows to configure and read
values from all three sensors of the device. For an overview on the supported
features, you can check the driver's documentation in @ref drivers_mpu9x50.

A sample RIOT application for the MPU-9150 that utilizes the driver can be
found [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/tests/driver_mpu9x50).

### Other components

For the following components of the MSB-IoT, there is currently no support in
RIOT:
* [TCA6416 16-Bit I/O Expander](http://www.ti.com/product/tca6416)
* Micro-SD-Card Interface


# Compiling, Flashing and Debugging

This section only covers the automated functionality provided by RIOT's
makefile system. If you don't want to rely on RIOT's make targets for flashing
or debugging (for instance to use a different flashing tool), please check the
documentation of your used tools.


### Prerequisites

We strongly recommend the usage of the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain for the MSB-IoT.
Support for other toolchains was not tested!

RIOT's provided functionality for debugging and flashing the MSB-IoT is based
on the [Open On-Chip Debugger](http://openocd.org/) tool. A wiki page with
installation instructions and some other information can be found
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD).


### Quick start

For a quick getting started guide you can stick to the steps explained on
[this page](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Getting-started-with-STM32F%5B0%7C3%7C4%5Ddiscovery-boards). Just make sure to use "msbiot" as the
respective board name.

### Using the UART for STDIO

The MCU's USART2 is set as the default input/output for the MSB-IoT inside
RIOT (mapped to UART_0). It is initialized and configured automatically for
every RIOT application and can be used for communication with your computer. The
easiest way is to use an USB to TTL adapter:

Step 1: Connect your adapter and the boards pin strip with RX<=>PA02,
TX<=>PA03 and GND<=>GND

Step 2: Done. The MCUs USART2 is used as STDIO.
