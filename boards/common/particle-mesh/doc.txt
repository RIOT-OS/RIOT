@brief       Common support for the Particle Mesh boards family (Xenon, Argon, Boron)

### General information

[Particle Mesh](https://www.particle.io/mesh/) are mesh-ready development kits.
Depending on the board type (Xenon, Argon, Boron), it provides access to
multiple communication protocols: BLE, 802.15.4, WiFi, LTE.

### Flash the board

Using the [Particle Mesh debugger](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/accessories/mesh-accessories/#debugger),
the board can be flashed with PyOCD programmer via a DAPLink.

PyOCD can be installed using Python package manager:
```
    pip install pyocd --user -U
```

To flash the board, use `BOARD=<board name>` (with board name in {particle-argon,
particle-boron, particle-xenon}) with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=particle-xenon -C examples/hello-world flash
```

In this case, OpenOCD can also be used. For the moment, the latest stable
version of OpenOCD (0.10) doesn't contain any support for nrf52 but versions
built against the actual development version can be used.

To flash the board with OpenOCD, use the `PROGRAMMER` variable:
```
    PROGRAMMER=openocd make BOARD=<board name> -C examples/hello-world flash
```

#### Alternative flashing procedure: Particle bootloader and DFU-Util

As an alternative to using the Particle Mesh debugger,
the USB DFU mode bootloader shipped with Particle Mesh devices can be used.
That mode can be entered by keeping the SETUP/MODE button pressed after power-up or reset
until the RGB LED **blinks yellow fast**.

In this mode, the bootloader and Soft Device are kept in place,
reducing the available flash memory to 784kB,
but in turn, devices can easily be switched back to using Particle software.

In order to use this mode, set `PARTICLE_MONOFIRMWARE=1` wherever you set the `BOARD`.
This will trigger the use of the appropriate linker script,
and switch in [`dfu-util`](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) as the default programmer,
which needs to be installed.
<!-- Using PARTICLE_MONOFIRMWARE=1 images with an external programmer is untested but might just work once checksums are static. -->

On Linux hosts, devices for the DFU mode are frequently only accessible to root,
causing error messages like

    dfu-util: Cannot open DFU device 2b04:d00e
    dfu-util: No DFU capable USB device available

To make Particle devices writable for all users,
follow [Particle's instructions](https://docs.particle.io/support/particle-tools-faq/installing-dfu-util/)
on setting up dfu-util.

The Particle bootloader checks the firmware's checksum at startup time.
As these checks would be frustrated by flash writes inside RIOT (typically using the @ref drivers_periph_flashpage),
the CFLAG @ref PARTICLE_MONOFIRMWARE_CHECKSUMLIMIT "-DPARTICLE_MONOFIRMWARE_CHECKSUMLIMIT" can be set.
Then, the checksum is only calculated over the memory region that contains the interrupt vector and the bootloader manifest.

### Reset the board

The on-board reset button doesn't work, so to trigger a reset of the board, use
the `reset` target with `make`:
```
    make BOARD=<board name> -C examples/hello-world reset
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is not accessible via the USB port.

To access the STDIO of RIOT, a FTDI to USB converter needs to be plugged to
the RX/TX pins on the board.

### nRF antenna selection

The Particle Mesh boards all have two antenna choices for their nRF (Bluetooth
/ 802.15.4) radios, a on-board antenna and a U.FL connector for an external
antenna.

By default, the on-board antenna is selected at startup. That choice can be
overridden by setting ``BOARD_NRFANTENNA_DEFAULT = EXTERNAL`` (as opposed to
the default ``BUILTIN``) in a project's `Makefile`, or at runtime using @ref
board_nrfantenna_select function.

The external antenna connection should only be enabled if a suitable antenna is
connected.
