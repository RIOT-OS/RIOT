/**
 * @name    External oscillator and clock configuration
 *
 * For selection of the used CORECLOCK, we have implemented two choices:
 *
 * - usage of the PLL fed by the internal 8MHz oscillator divided by 8
 * - usage of the internal 8MHz oscillator directly, divided by N if needed
 *
 *
 * The PLL option allows for the usage of a wider frequency range and a more
 * stable clock with less jitter. This is why we use this option as default.
 *
 * The target frequency is computed from the PLL multiplier and the PLL divisor.
 * Use the following formula to compute your values:
 *
 * CORECLOCK = ((PLL_MUL + 1) * 1MHz) / PLL_DIV
 *
 * NOTE: The PLL circuit does not run with less than 32MHz while the maximum PLL
 *       frequency is 96MHz. So PLL_MULL must be between 31 and 95!
 *
 *
 * The internal Oscillator used directly can lead to a slightly better power
 * efficiency to the cost of a less stable clock. Use this option when you know
 * what you are doing! The actual core frequency is adjusted as follows:
 *
 * CORECLOCK = 8MHz / DIV
 *
 * NOTE: A core clock frequency below 1MHz is not recommended
 *
