# Some revisions of the Bluepills use a CS32F103C8T6 rather than the STM32Fx
# MCU, which has a different CPUTAPID than the official STM32F103C8T6. As of
# 2020-04-09, no upstream support in OpenOCD has been merged. You can uncomment
# the following line as a workaround until your OpenOCD supports this option:
#set CPUTAPID 0x2ba01477

# Set the default reset option in cases where "SRST=none" is not used for make
if { ![info exists SRST_OPT] } {
   set SRST_OPT srst_only
}

# use hardware reset, connect under reset
# connect_assert_srst needed if low power mode application running (WFI...)

set CONNECT_UNDER_RESET 1

# brutally overwriting detected flash size with 128KiB (OpenOCD > 0.10.0)
set FLASH_SIZE 0x20000
