## Flashing

The MSB-A2 is programmed via an ISP bootloader over UART. The board includes
an FTDI USB-TTL converter, which is connected to the left USB Mini-B connector
(see picture above). Connect the MSB-A2 using that connector to your PC and
run from within the folder of your application to flash:

    BOARD=msba2 make flash

You'll notice that during the first invocation takes a bit longer, as the tool
`lpc2k_pgm` used to flash the MSB-A2 is also compiled.

You can connect to the shell by running:

    BOARD=msba2 make term

## Debugging

Some rigorous hardware modification is needed to access the JTAG interface of
the MSB-A2.

The following wires need to be soldered on:

| Signal        | Place                                                     |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| JTAG-TDO      | IC2, Pin 1                                                |
| JTAG-TDI      | IC2, Pin 2                                                |
| JTAG-TMS      | IC2, Pin 3                                                |
| JTAG-TRST     | IC2, Pin 4                                                |
| JTAG-TCK      | IC2, Pin 5                                                |
| JTAG-RTCK (*) | IC2, Pin 100                                              |
| RESET         | right pad of R6 (easier to solder) **or** IC2, Pin 17     |
| GND           | The bottom left through-hole pad                          |

(*) You can safely omit the connection to JTAG-RTCK.

As debugger an FT2232HL is used, the cheapest version costs less 10€ (often
nicknamed CJMCU-2232HL).

Connect as follows:

| FT2232HL  | MSB-A2    |
|:----------|:----------|
| GND       | GND       |
| AD0       | JTAG-TCK  |
| AD1       | JTAG-TDI  |
| AD2       | JTAG-TDO  |
| AD3       | JTAG-TMS  |
| AD4       | JTAG-TRST |
| AD5       | RESET     |

Once this is done, debugging is as simple as running:

    BOARD=msba2 make debug

### Flashing via OpenOCD

Theoretically you should be able to flash also via JTAG. But do not expect this
to be faster. Also: Do you really want to risk bricking the MSB-A2 you spend so
much time to modify? The author of this text surely didn't want to risk that...
