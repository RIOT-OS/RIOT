## Overview
The STM32F469I Discovery kit is a complete development platform for powered by ARM Cortex-M4 core-based
STM32F469NIH6 MCU.
The MCU presents a large list of peripherals available, but specifically this development board exposes:

## Connectors and Pinout

- 1 USB Mini-B used by the On-board ST-LINK debugger (Ref.CN1)
- 1 USB Micro-AB Full speed (Ref. CN13)
- Arduino(R) Uno expansion connectors (Refs. CN5/6/7/8)
- microSD(tm) card receptacle.
- Audio 3.5 mm stereo jack

Through 2 connector we have available:

### CN11

- I2C1
- Reset

Also provides power pins, 3V3 and GND

### CN12

This extension connector gives access to:

- CAN2
- USART6 (Tx, Rx)
- I2S2
- SPI1
- 7 timers channels.
- Speaker output (1W)

Also provides some system signals and power.

**Important!** note than some pins are shared between peripherals.

## Buttons, LEDS and other devices

- 1 Button for reset.
- 1 User button.
- 4 LEDs.
- 3 Digital microphones
- 1 LCD Color 4"

## Working with this Dev-Kit

To start the **gcc-arm-embedded** toolchain have to be installed,
we can follow the usual process [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-ARM).

## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board using OpenOCD

The start install **OpenOCD**, also we can follow the usual process
[here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD)

Once everything is installed and ready to work just connect the board through
the USB Mini-B connector try to compile and flash some code, type:

```
make flash BOARD=stm32f469i-disco
```

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=stm32f469i-disco PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware update
s
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sts
w-link007.html).
