##### Note on at86rf231 radio driver

The current implementation of the radio driver for the at86rf231 chip uses
the basic operation modes. This gives
you basic sending and receiving functionality but no hardware address
filtering and no auto-ACKs etc. Due to the fact this radio device is an IEEE
802.15.4 compliant device it supports radio channels from 11 to 26. When trying
to set a channel out of range the driver returns an error and prints a message
with `DEVELHELP` enabled.

## Toolchains

See [ARM Family](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-ARM)

Working:
* [gcc-arm-embedded](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-ARM#gcc-
arm-embedded-toolchain)
* [gcc-linaro](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-ARM#linaro-
toolchain)

### Programming and Debugging

In order to program (flash) and debug the node you need
[OpenOCD](http://openocd.sourceforge.net/) and an ARM version of gdb (`arm-none-
eabi-gdb`), which provided by most toolchains. Most Linux distributions provide
also a package for OpenOCD. The required configuration files are provided by
RIOT.
When starting the debugger with `make debug BOARD=fox` GDB connects to
openocd, loads the elf-file and puts the MCU into halt state. Before setting
breakpoints it is sometimes needed to use the following workflow
```
bash
monitor reset run
monitor reset halt
b <breakpoint>
c
```
For best debugging experience also change the `-Os` flag in
`Makefile.inlcude`'s `CFLAGS` variable to `-O0`.

## Debugging

For debugging you need to open a terminal. Here you simply have to call `make
debug` - assuming that the current directory is your application directory. It
establishes an openocd connection to the device and starts gdb connected to the
openocd instance. For example, it should look something like this
```
[user@host RIOT]$ cd examples/default/
[user@host default]$ BOARD=fox make
Building application default for fox w/ MCU stm32f1.
...
[user@hostdefault]$ BOARD=fox make debug

Continuing.
```

The node will reboot and you can continue to use `gdb` like you're used to.
In some cases it
seems necessary to prepend a `monitor reset run` before executing continue.
In general you can
use openocd commands prepended by `monitor`.
In the case the node crashes it can be reseted with the following sequence
```
Bash
(gdb) monitor reset halt
(gdb) monitor reset run
```

## Troubleshooting

For terminal output on OS X (`make term`) you need to install a driver:
