@brief       Support for the Particle Boron

### General information

[Particle Boron](https://docs.particle.io/boron/) is a mesh-ready development kit
that provides access to multiple communication protocols: BLE, 802.15.4 and LTE.

The board datasheet is available [here](https://docs.particle.io/assets/pdfs/datasheets/boron-datasheet.pdf)

@experimental Support to measure the voltage via ADC using the
`board_bat_voltage` feature (see [Feature List](@ref feature-list)) is provided
for this board. However, it was only ever tested for the very similar
@ref boards_particle-xenon. If you encounter any errors when measuring the
voltage for the Particle Boron, please report this!

### Flash the board

See the `Flashing` section in @ref boards_common_particle-mesh.
