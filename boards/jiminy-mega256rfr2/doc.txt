 * @brief       Support for the Jiminy Mega 256rfr2 board

# Overview
The Jiminy board is a development of the
[Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems](http://www.ias.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~gair/IAS/?lidx=1)
(IAS) of the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). We started the project by porting
RIOT OS to the [Pinoccio.io](https://github.com/Pinoccio/hardware-pinoccio) board. As there where severe
limitations we designed the Jiminy board which has the the
[ATmega256rfr2](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-8393-MCU_Wireless-ATmega256RFR2-ATmega128RFR2-ATmega64RFR2_Datasheet.pdf)
MCU as common feature.

It is Arduino like and features USB programming. The [Bootloader](https://github.com/Josar/arduino_stk500v2)
is a fork of the Arduino Bootloader with added functionality for internal clock calibration and automatic baud
rate detection.

The Jiminy is design as a core board featuring a MCU, RF-transceiver, battery charger and power path management
IC, a fuel gauge, an adjustable power supply between 1.8V to 3.3V (100mV Steps) and an RGB LED. All unused Pins
are connected to pin headers.

An USB C connector is used to connect to the computer or the charger. As USB C supports up to 3 ampere the board
was designed in regard of fast charging and when connected to the grid or usage of big batteries high current
supply capability for the shield.

The shields can be powered either directly from the Charger/battery or from the adjustable converter, the
converter supply pin can be enabled or disabled by the application. By connecting shields to the core Jiminy
board, a multitude of wireless applications can be created.

A first shield for temperature, humidity and soil moisture measurement is also developed at the IAS.

If there is demand for devices please contact the author of this page for more details.

# Flashing RIOT
Flashing RIOT on the Jiminy is quite straight forward, just connect your Jiminy using the USB port
to your host computer and type:

`make flash BOARD=jiminy-mega256rfr2`

This should take care of everything!

RIOT's Makefile are configured to flash the jiminy using AVRDUDE. The bootloader automatically matches
to the configured baud rate which is set for AVRDUDE. Rates of up to 500kBaud can be used.

# Fuse Settings
Reading out the fuses can be done with
`avrdude -c wiring -p m256rfr2 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 0010005 -v`

The last line should read
`avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FE, H:D0, L:E2)`

Which describes the fuses as follows:
E: extended fuse = FE
H: high fuse     = D0
L: low fuse      = E2

To program the fuses an JTAG programer (Atmel-ICE, Dragon) is needed, they can not be set with the bootloader.
Connect the programmer JTAG pins with the board pins F4 JTAG TCK, F5 JTAG TMS, F6 JTAG TDO, F7 JTAG TDI,
GND and VDD with V+ m256rfr2. Alternatively use a pogo pin connector ( e.g. SparkFun ISP Pogo Adapter)
on the backside of the board.

To program the fuses default setting execute following line
`avrdude -c atmelice -p m256rfr2 -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xd0:m -U efuse:w:0xfe:m`

Attention: the default setting above has brown-out detection enabled,
see troubleshooting when using the board with 1.8V supply.

# Troubleshooting

## Using 1.8V as board Voltage

Setting the TPS6274x output voltage to 1.8V may lead to an undervoltage and thus triggers the brown-out reset.
Disabling the brown-out detection by setting the extended fuse bit is recommended when a 1.8V supply is used.

`avrdude -c atmelice -p m256rfr2 -U efuse:w:0xff:m`

## Using the external crystal oscillator (Transceiver Crystal Oscillator) and deep sleep

When the external crystal oscillator is used as system clock and the device is put into deep sleep mode it seems that
the clocks for all peripherals are enabled and set to the smallest divider (highest frequency). This leads to a higher
power consumption. When the device should be put into deep sleep it is recommended to use the internal RC oscillator
as system clock source.
