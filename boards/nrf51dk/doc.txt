@brief       Support for the Nordic nRF51DK Development Kit

## Overview:

The nRF51 DK is a low-cost, versatile single-board development kit for
Bluetooth low energy, ANT and 2.4GHz proprietary applications using the nRF51
Series SoC.

## Flashing the Device:

The nRF51DK board is shipped with an on-board JLink debugger that doesn't work
well with UART: the shell is only working on RX but not TX.

Thus, we recommend to update the flasher ship with DAPLink as described
[here](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink/?board=Nordic-nRF51-DK):
1. Download [this firmware](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink//firmware/0251_sam3u2c_mkit_dk_dongle_nrf5x_0x5000.bin)
2. While holding down the boards reset button, connect the boards USB debug
   port to the computer. It should enumerate as `BOOTLOADER`
3. Using a filesystem browser, drag-n-drop the firmware file to the
   `BOOTLOADER` folder
4. Power-cycle the board, a new DAPLink mount point should appear

The programmer used to flash this board is OpenOCD.

To flash the board, use the following command:
```
$ make BOARD=nrf51dk flash
```
from any application directory.
