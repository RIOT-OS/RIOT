# NXP Kinetis Freedom developer board
#
# OpenSDA is the on-board debugger, some boards have a CMSIS-DAP compatible
# interface, other boards comes pre-flashed with a Segger J-Link compatible
# firmware. The OpenSDA controller can be re-flashed to provide either of the two.
# Both interfaces work with OpenOCD, but we need to tell which one we have on
# our debugger.

# J-Link compatible firmware binaries for OpenSDA can be found at:
