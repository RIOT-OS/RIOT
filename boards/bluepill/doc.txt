@brief       Support for the stm32f103c8 based bluepill board.

## Overview

The bluepill is an STM32F103 based board which can be bought for around
2€ on sides like AliExpress, eBay and others. Although the STM32F130C8
MCU nominally has 64 KB flash, most [actually have 128 KB
flash][Flashsize].

## Flashing

To program and debug the board you need a SWD capable debugger. The
easiest way is using [OpenOCD][OpenOCD]. If you have OpenOCD installed,
you can flash the device with:

    $ make BOARD=bluepill flash

### Additional Flash

To make use of the entire 128 KB flash, compile your application with:

    $ make BOARD=bluepill CPU_MODEL=stm32f103cb

This sets the `CPU_MODEL` make variable to `stm32f103cb`, the default
value is `stm32f103c8`. These two CPU models basically only have one
major difference, the latter has 128 KB flash while the former has 64
KB.

If you want to flash a binary compiled this way you either need to
figure out how to adjust the OpenOCD configuration to make it use 128 KB
flash or use this [stlink fork][caboStlink] which has a
[patch][caboPatch] to make use of the entire 128 KB flash using:

    $ C8T6HACK=1 st-flash write /dev/sgX $pathToHexFile 0x8000000


## Connecting via Serial

The default UART port used is UART2, which uses pins A2 (TX) and A3 (RX).

## Using PWM

PWM is available at pins A8 to A11.

## Known Issues

### USB connector

The Micro-USB port is sometimes not soldered properly. Also, it is
usually equipped with an incorrect resistor. [This can be fixed multiple
ways][USB].

### Flashing abortion

Some boards have problems to flash on the first try. It may help, to press
the reset-button, start the flashing and release it while doing so.


## Where to buy

The board is sold under different names. On some sites it is called
`bluepill` or `blue pill`. On others you might find it by searching for
`stm32f103c8` or `stm32f103c8t6`.

Try [eBay][eBay] or [AliExpress][AliExpress].
