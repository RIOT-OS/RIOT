# Hardware
## Pinout

![corerf-pinout](https://wiki.microduinoinc.com/images/d/df/RF%E5%BC%95%E8%84%9A.jpg)

Warning: Unlike on other ATmega MCUs, the GPIOs are not 5V tolerant.

## Board
The board is just a breakout for the ATmega128RFA1 MCU.

## MCU Details

| Datasheet / Reference Manual | [Datasheet and Reference Manual](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-8266-MCU_Wireless-ATmega128RFA1_Datasheet.pdf) |
| Board Manual   | [Wiki Page](https://wiki.microduinoinc.com/Microduino-Module_CoreRF) |

The MCU comes with a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio that is compatible with the
Atmel AT86RF23x line of transceivers with the only difference being that it is
not being accessed over an SPI bus, but instead the radio registers are directly
mapped into memory.

# Flashing RIOT
Flashing RIOT on the CoreRF is done using the SPI method.
Using a cheap FT232H breakout board, connect the board as follows:

| FT232H | Microduino CoreRF |
|:------ |:----------------- |
|  D0    | D13 (SCK)         |
|  D1    | D11 (MOSI)        |
|  D2    | D12 (MISO)        |
|  D3    | RST (Reset)       |
|  3.3V  | 3.3V              |
|  GND   | GND               |

Now you can simply type

`make flash BOARD=microduino-corerf`

This should take care of everything!

You will need a separate adapter for UART:

| FT232R | Microduino CoreRF |
|:------ |:----------------- |
|  TX    | D0                |
|  RX    | D1                |

# Troubleshooting

## Using the external crystal oscillator (Transceiver Crystal Oscillator) and deep sleep

When the external crystal oscillator is used as system clock and the device is put into deep sleep mode it seems that
the clocks for all peripherals are enabled and set to the smallest divider (highest frequency). This leads to a higher
power consumption. When the device should be put into deep sleep it is recommended to use the internal RC oscillator
as system clock source.

## Pin Change Interrupts

More pins can be used for hardware interrupts using the Pin Change
Interrupt feature. See @ref boards_common_atmega for details.
