@brief       Support for the MikroE 6LoWPAN Clicker

## Overview

The `6lowpan clicker` is an evaluation board by Mikroe featuring a
PIC32MX470F512H, a 6lowpan radio (CA810) by Cascoda and a Mikrobus
socket for expansion boards.

More general information on the board and related documentation can be found
[here](https://www.mikroe.com/clicker-6lowpan). Schematics for the board can be
found in the [manual](https://download.mikroe.com/documents/starter-boards/clicker/6lowpan/6lowpan-clicker-manual-v100.pdf).

## Using UART

This board doesn't open an UART or serial interface through the USB
automatically, and the USB device driver hasn't been implemented to RIOT.
Therefore, to open an UART interface one has to connect a usb/ttl converter to
the UART3 pins RF5 (RX) and RF4 (TX) available on the Mikrobus socket.

## Flashing the device

There are two ways to flash the MCU:
  * Using MPLAB-IPE and a PICkit 3 (The RIOT build generates a hexfile
    compatible with MPLAB-IPE)
  * Using pic32prog and a PICkit 2 or a PICkit 3 (other devices might be
    supported by pic32prog but were not tested). This is the preferred option
    as it makes possible to flash the device using `make flash` command.

## Supported Toolchains

For using the 6lowpan-clicker board we strongly recommend the usage of the
[Codescape GNU Tools](https://codescape.mips.com) toolchain.
