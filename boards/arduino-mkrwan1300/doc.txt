 *
 * ### General information
 *
 * The [Arduino MKR WAN 1300](https://store.arduino.cc/mkr-wan-1300) board is
 * a learning and development board that provides LoRa connectivity and is
 * powered by an Atmel SAMD21 microcontroller.

 *
 * ### Flash the board
 *
 * 1. Put the board in bootloader mode by double tapping the reset button.<br/>
 *    When the board is in bootloader mode, the user led (amber) oscillates
 *    smoothly.
 *
 *
 * 2. Use `BOARD=arduino-mkrwan1300` with the `make` command.<br/>
 *    Example with `hello-world` application:
 * ```
 *      make BOARD=arduino-mkrwan1300 -C examples/hello-world flash
 * ```
 *
 * @warning Unplug the board from the anti-static protective foam before
 *          starting to use it otherwise it may not work as expected.
 *
 * ### Accessing STDIO via UART
 *
 * To access the STDIO of RIOT, a FTDI to USB converted needs to be plugged to
 * the RX/TX pins on the board.
