@brief       Support for the mbed LPC1768 board

## Overview

mbed LPC1768 is a small development board by ARM. A LPC1768, an Ethernet PHY
transceiver (DP83848J), a 2MB flash device (AT45DB161D) and a MBED-IF01
(LPC2148) are present on the board.
This board aims to make it very easy to flash a new firmware. There is no
need for an external programmer. The sole purpose of the MBED-IF01 is to
appear as a USB flash drive when the board is connected over USB to a
computer. The most recent binary file stored on the USB drive is flashed on
the next reset.

about the board.

### User Interface

1 Button:

| NAME   |  SW1  |
|:-----  |:----- |
| Pin    | RESET |

5 LEDs:

| NAME  | LED1  | LED2  | LED3  | LED4  | STATUS |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Color | blue  | blue  | blue  | blue  | blue   |

## Using UART

This board opens a serial interface through the USB automatically.

## Supported Toolchains

For using the mbed LPC1768 board we strongly recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.

## Flashing the device

The easiest way to flash the device is to connect to the board via USB. The
board appears as a 2MB usb drive. `make flash` will copy your binary file to
the root directory but you need to manually reset your board by pressing the
reset button.
While the LPC1768 is flashed by the MBED-IF01 with the new firmware, the
status LED blinks fast.

## Known Issues
* Does not compile with the mentor graphics toolchain (compare
https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/751)
