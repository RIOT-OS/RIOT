@brief       Support for the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

### General information

The [Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) board
is an opensource, micro development kit using the nRF52840 SoC.
This board provides 802.15.4 and BLE connectivity.

### Pinout

### Flash the board

Use `BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble-sense` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble-sense -C examples/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port. On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=arduino-nano-33-ble-sense -C examples/hello-world term
```
