@brief       Support for the STM32 Nucleo-L552ZE-Q

## Flashing the device

The ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.
@note The upstream version of OpenOCD doesn't contain yet support for this board,
so the source code version from http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/5510
must be built to be able to flash this board (adapt the configure command with
your preferred installation directory):

```
$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
$ cd openocd
$ git fetch http://openocd.zylin.com/openocd refs/changes/10/5510/5 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=<installation directory>
$ make -j
$ sudo make install
```

Once the patched OpenOCD is built and installed, you can flash the board simply
by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-l552ze-q flash
```

and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l552ze-q debug
```

## Supported Toolchains

For using the ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board we recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.
