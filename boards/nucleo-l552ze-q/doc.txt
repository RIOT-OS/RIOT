## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

The ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD.
@note The upstream version of OpenOCD doesn't contain yet support for this board,
so the source code version from http://openocd.zylin.com/#/c/5510
must be built to be able to flash this board (adapt the configure command with
your preferred installation directory):

```
$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
$ cd openocd
$ git fetch http://openocd.zylin.com/openocd refs/changes/10/5510/5 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=<installation directory>
$ make -j
$ sudo make install
```

Once the patched OpenOCD is built and installed, you can flash the board simply
by typing

```
make BOARD=nucleo-l552ze-q flash
```

and debug via GDB by simply typing
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l552ze-q debug
```

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l552ze-q PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

## Accessing RIOT shell

Default RIOT shell access utilize VCP (Virtual COM Port) via USB interface,
provided by integrated ST-LINK programmer. ST-LINK is connected to the
microcontroller LPUART1.

The default baud rate is 115 200.

If a physical connection to LPUART1 is needed, connect UART interface to pins
PG7 (LPUART1 TX) and PG8 (LPUART1 RX).

@note Accordingly to the [MCU Datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32l552ze.pdf)
PG7 and PG8 pins are 5V tolerant (see table 21, page 108).

## Supported Toolchains

For using the ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board we recommend the usage of the
[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.
