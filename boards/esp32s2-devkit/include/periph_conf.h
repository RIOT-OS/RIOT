 * @brief       Peripheral configurations for ESP32-S2-DevKit boards
 * @{
 *
 * The peripheral configurations in this file can be used for Espressif
 * ESP32-S2-DevKitx boards that use one of the following modules:
 *
 * - ESP32-S2-MINI-1x module (ESP32-S2-DevKitM-1x board)
 * - ESP32-S2-SOLO module (ESP32-S2-DevKitC-1x board)
 * - ESP32-S2-WROOM module (ESP32-S2-Saola-1 board)
 * - ESP32-S2-WROVER module (ESP32-S2-Saola-1R board)
 *
 * Any modifications required for specific applications
 * can be overridden by \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration".
 *
 * For detailed information about the peripheral configuration for ESP32-S2
 * boards, see section \ref esp32_peripherals "Common Peripherals".
 *
 * @note
 * Most definitions can be overridden by an \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration" if necessary.
