### RESET pin configuration

On many (all?) nrf52dk boards, the reset pin is not configured out-of-the box.
This means, that simply nothing happens if the RESET pin is pressed. To change
this, RIOT provides a little tool in `dist/tools/nrf52_resetpin_cfg`.

Simply compile, flash, and run that tool on your board, and the reset pin should
work for the time being.

## Current measurement:

There are two pins for current measurement on board. Don't connect these pins
to GND!. The left pin is at 3.3V level and the right pin is connected to V33.
Divide the measured voltage between this pins by 22 to get the current.

## Flash the board

See the `Flashing` section in @ref boards_common_nrf52.

## Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port. On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=nrf52dk -C examples/basic/hello-world term
```
