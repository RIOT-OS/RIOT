@brief       Support for the nRF52840 DK


### RESET pin configuration

On many (all?) nrf52840dk boards, the reset pin is not configured out-of-the box.
This means, that simply nothing happens if the RESET pin is pressed. To change
this, RIOT provides a little tool in `dist/tools/nrf52_resetpin_cfg`.

Simply compile, flash, and run that tool on your board, and the reset pin should
work for the time being.

## Flash the board

By default, the board is flashed with via the on-board Segger JLink adapter.

To flash the board, use `BOARD=nrf52840dk` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=nrf52840dk -C examples/hello-world flash
```

OpenOCD can also be used. For the moment, the latest stable version of OpenOCD
(0.10) doesn't contain any support for nrf52 but versions built against the
actual development version can be used.

To flash the board with OpenOCD, use the `PROGRAMMER` variable:
```
    PROGRAMMER=openocd make BOARD=nrf52840dk -C examples/hello-world flash
```

## Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port. On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=nrf52840dk -C examples/hello-world term
```
