## Schematics

## Pinout

The 64 pins on the edges of the PCB are connected to the corresponding MCU pins.
Hence, the following pinout of the naked MSP430-F1611 MCU chip matches the
pinout of the header board:

## Flashing RIOT

<img src="https://github.com/maribu/images/raw/master/Olimex%20MSP430-H1611%20with%20Debugger.jpeg" alt="Photo of Olimex MSP430-H1611 Board connected to a JTAG Debugger" style="width: 512px; max-width: 100%;">

Connect the board to a JTAG debugger supported by
[mspdebug](https://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/); by default the
Olimex MSP430-JTAG-Tiny (as shown in the picture above) is assumed, which is
among the less expensive options.

@note       If you are not using the Olimex MSP430-JTAG-Tiny (or a compatible
            programmer), set `MSPDEBUG_PROGRAMMER` to the correct value via
            an environment variable or as parameter to make. E.g. use
            `make BOARD=olimex-msp430-h1611 MSPDEBUG_PROGRAMMER=bus-pirate` to
            flash using the bus pirate.

@warning    You can power the board via the JTAG programmer by placing a
            jumper at `P_IN`. However, the JTAG programmer will only be able
            to provide a limited current. You may want to disconnect the
            header board from devices consuming a lot of power prior to
            flashing.

@warning    If the board is powered externally, make sure to place the jumper
            in `P_OUT` position, not in `P_IN` position.

@warning    A jumper in `P_OUT` is mutually exclusive to a jumper in `P_IN`.
            Never connect both at the same time.

@note       Pin 1 on the JTAG connector has a small white triangle next to it
            and square pad, compared to the round pad used by all other JTAG
            pins.

Once the jumper is correctly placed in either `P_IN` or in `P_OUT` and the
JTAG cable is connected just run

```
make BOARD=olimex-msp430-h1611 flash
```

## Using the shell

stdio is available via the UART interface with `TXD = P3.6`
(pin 35 on the header) and `RXD = P3.7` (pin 34 on the header) at 9,600 Baud.

The easiest way is to connect an USB TTL adapter (such as the cheap `cp210x`
or `ch341` based adapters) as follows:

```
TTL adapter    Olimex MSP430-H1611
-----------    -------------------

       GND --- 63 (DV_SS)
       TXD --- 35 (P3.7)
       RXD --- 34 (P3.6)
```
