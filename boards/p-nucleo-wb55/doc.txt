@brief       Support for the STM32 p-nucleo-wb55

## Overview

The p-nucleo-wb55 is a multi-protocol wireless and ultra-low-power
device embedding a powerful and ultra-low-power radio compliant with the
BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) SIG specification v5.0 and with IEEE
802.15.4-2011 board. It integrates an ARM Cortex-M4 STM32WB55RG microcontroller
with 256KB of RAM and 1MB of ROM Flash.

## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

The ST p-nucleo-wb55 board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
flashed using OpenOCD (use version 0.11.0 at least).

To flash this board, just use the following command:

```
make BOARD=p-nucleo-wb55 flash -C examples/hello-world
```

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task could be
performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable media) PROGRAMMER
script does this automatically. To program board in this manner, use the command:

```
make BOARD=p-nucleo-wb55 PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sts
-link007.html).


## Accessing RIOT shell

Default RIOT shell access utilize VCP (Virtual COM Port) via USB interface,
provided by integrated ST-LINK programmer. In default configuration ST-LINK
is connected to the microcontroller USART1. For more details See table 7,
page 33 in board User Manual.

The default baud rate is 115 200.

Use the `term` target to open a terminal:
```
make BOARD=p-nucleo-wb55 -C examples/hello-world term
```
