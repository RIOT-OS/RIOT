@brief       Support for the MPFS Icicle Kit ES

## Overview:
This board provides support for Microchip PolarFire SoC (Engineering Sample).

## openOCD
This board needs a special version of openOCD. Upstream support is supposed to be ongoing.
For now, the only way to get this openOCD version is by installing the Libero tool (available
on Windows and GNU/Linux).
If you already have an openOCD installed in your PATH environment, you can still use a
custom openOCD by calling `OPENOCD=/path/to/openocd/bin/openocd make ..`

## Flash the board

`make flash` is currently unsupported. To test your application, please use
`make debug` for now. It will load the application to the LIM memory which is
volatile. You need to Microchip custom openOCD and make sure to have GDB
in your PATH environment.

TODO: add fpgenprog tool support to RIOT to use it with 'make flash' to
flash the eNVM memory.

## Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is directly accessible via the USB port (J1). On a Linux host, it's
generally mapped to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
MMUART0 is mapped to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Use the `term` target to connect to the board serial port<br/>
```
    make BOARD=mpfs-icicle-kit-es -C examples/hello-world term
```
