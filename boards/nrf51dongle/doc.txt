@brief       Support for the Nordic nRF51 Dongle

## Overview:
The nRF51822 is a multi-protocol SoC ideally suited for Bluetooth® low energy
and 2.4GHz ultra low-power wireless applications from Nordic Semiconductor. The
nRF51822 is built around a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™ M0 CPU with 256kB flash + 16kB
RAM. The embedded 2.4GHz transceiver supports Bluetooth low energy as well as
2.4GHz operation.

Nordic's development kit contains two different boards:
- **pca10000**: a USB-dongle containing the nRF51822 and a RGB-Led
- **pca10005**: two a basic nRF51822 boards making the MCU pins available

While the pca10000 contains an on-board J-Link debugger, the pca10005 boards
have to be flashed/debugged using the (included) external J-Link device.

## Flashing the Device:
The nRF51822 PC10000 board is shipped with an on-board JLink debugger.
However the PC10004/5 board uses an external flash tool as seen in the Image
above. Under Linux, the easiest way flashing the nRF51822 is using the JLink
tool(version >4.85) from [Segger](http://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html).

To interact with the board just start the tool using the following command:
`# JLinkExe -device nrf51822`

For RIOT itself there is a Flash-Script available. When using any of the
Examples type in the following command:
`# Make -B clean flash`
