@brief       Support for the Mega1284P-Xplained board.

### General information

The [Mega1284P-Xplained](http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=atmega1284p-xpld)
is an evaluation kit by Atmel (now Microchip) for their ATmega1284P microcontroller.

### Flash the board

1. The board may be flashed through JTAG or using a SPI ISP programmer. If
   the Buspirate is being used, then `make flash` can be used to flash the
   board:
```
     make BOARD=mega-xplained -C examples/hello-world flash
```

2. The default fuse settings must also be changed.<br/>
   If using the Buspirate:
```
     avrdude -p m1284p -c buspirate -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U efuse:w:0xFF:m
     avrdude -p m1284p -c buspirate -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U hfuse:w:0x99:m
     avrdude -p m1284p -c buspirate -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m
```
WARNING: setting the fuses incorrectly can brick your board!

### Accessing STDIO via UART

STDIO can be accessed through the USB connector. The on-board UART-USB
adapter is not affected by flashing. It shows up as /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux.
It will be used automatically with `make term`:
```
     make BOARD=mega-xplained -C examples/hello-world term
```
