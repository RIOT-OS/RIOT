## Supported Toolchains

For using the Nucleo-L152RE board we strongly recommend the usage of the [GNU
Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
toolchain.

## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using OpenOCD

Please use an OpenOCD version checked out after Jan. 26th 2015. Building
instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD).

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-l152re PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER was tested using ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

## Using UART

Using the UART isn't too stable right now. For some using the USB interface
just works, others have to connect the USB interface to a active USB hub and
others again can only transmit over the USB interface and receive using an
external UART adapter.

#### Connecting an external UART adapter

1. connect your usb tty to the st-link header as marked

2. done
