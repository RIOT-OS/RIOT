@brief       Support for the Arduino Nano board

## Overview

The Arduino Nano is the cheapest member of the Arduino family. It is based on
Atmel's AVR architecture and sports an ATmega328p MCU. It is like many Arduinos
extensible by using shields.

## Flashing the device
Flashing RIOT on the Arduino Nano is quite straight forward, just connect your
Arduino Nano via the USB connector to your host computer and type:

`make BOARD=arduino-nano flash`

This should take care of everything!

We use the open `avrdude` tool to write the new code into the ATmega328p's
flash

##Caution
Don't expect having a working network stack due to very limited resources.
