 * @brief       Support for the STM32G031-DISCO board.
 *
 * ### General information
 *
 * The ST [STM32G031-DISCO](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32g0316-disco.html)
 * is an evaluation board supporting a ARM Cortex-M0 STM32G031J6 microcontroller
 * with 8KB of RAM and 32KB of ROM Flash.
 *
 * ### Pinout
 *
 * In an SO8 package, this MCU uses multi-bonding to run multiple ports to the same pins.
 * See [this application note as reference](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00443870-getting-started-with-stm32g0-series-hardware-development-stmicroelectronics.pdf).
 * This means the responsibility is on the firmware configurer to take special care when configured IO, ensuring that
 * ports are not conflicting on each pin.
 *
 * ### Flash the board
 *
 * The STM32G031-DISCO board includes an on-board ST-LINK programmer and can be
 * flashed using OpenOCD.
 *
 * To flash this board, just use the following command:
 *
 * ```
 * make BOARD=stm32g031-disco flash -C examples/hello-world
 * ```
 *
