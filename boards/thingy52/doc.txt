@brief       Support for the Nordic Thingy:52 board

## Flash the board

Use the J-Link Segger to flash the board. See the `Flashing` section in @ref
boards_common_nrf52.

## Term into the board

A shell into RIOT can be accessed via the J-Link Segger and its RTT (real time
transfer) technology. This allows serial data to be passed to/from the Segger
via (non-UART supporting) memory locations.

To use this, you need to run a debug client (e.g. gdb), a debug server (e.g.
JLinkExe), and a terminal client (e.g., PyTerm). The terminal client connects
to the debug server on port 19021. If you want to use the standard RIOT
toolchain, flash the board, open two terminal windows, and input the
following, all in your application directory:

Window 1: `BOARD=ruuvitag make debug`
Window 2: `BOARD=ruuvitag make term`
Window 1: (gdb) `c`

You will then be able to communicate with the RIOT shell in window 2.
