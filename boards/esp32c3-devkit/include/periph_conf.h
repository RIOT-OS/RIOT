/**
 * @ingroup     boards_esp32c3_devkit
 * @brief       Peripheral configurations for ESP32-C3-DevKit boards
 * @{
 *
 * The peripheral configurations in this file are valid for Espressif
 * ESP32-C3-DevKitx boards that use one of the following modules:
 *
 * - ESP32-C3-MINI-1x module (ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 board)
 * - ESP32-C3-WROOM-02x module (ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 board)
 *
 * Since the number of GPIOs and their possible uses on the ESP32-C3 are quite
 * limited, these peripheral configurations can also be used for most other
 * ESP32-C3 boards. Any modifications required for specific applications
 * can be overridden by \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration".
 *
 * For detailed information about the peripheral configuration for ESP32-C3
 * boards, see section \ref esp32_peripherals "Common Peripherals".
 *
 * @note
 * Most definitions can be overridden by an \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration" if necessary.
