 * @brief       Board definitions for ESP32-C3-DevKit boards
 * @{
 *
 * The board definitions in this file are valid for Espressif
 * ESP32-C3-DevKitx boards that use one of the following modules:
 *
 * - ESP32-C3-MINI-1x module (ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 board)
 * - ESP32-C3-WROOM-02x module (ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 board)
 *
 * Since the number of GPIOs and their possible uses on the ESP32-C3 are quite
 * limited, these board definitions can also be used for most other
 * ESP32-C3 boards. Any modifications required for specific applications
 * can be overridden by \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration".

/**
 * @name    LED (on-board) configuration

 * ESP32-C3-DevKit boards have a SK68XXMINI-HS smart RGB-LED connected to
 * GPIO8 on-board. This RGB-LEDs uses a special bit-oriented protocol to
 * control the RGB-LED by 24-bit RGB values. Therefore, it can't be used as
 * default LED definition for RIOT.
