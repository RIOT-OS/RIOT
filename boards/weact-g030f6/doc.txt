@brief       Support for the WeAct-G030F6 board

## Overview

WeAct-G030F6 is a cheap little board based on the STM32G030F6P6 MCU.
It does not come with a programmer or USB connection, so an external
programmer (ST-Link, DAP-Link, etc) has to be used.

It is available on sites like AliExpress for less than 2â‚¬.
