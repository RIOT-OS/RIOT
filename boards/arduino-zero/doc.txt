@brief       Support for the Arduino Zero board.

## Overview

The `Arduino Zero` is a board by Arduino/Genuino featuring a ATSAMD21G18A.
The SAMD21 is a ARM Cortex-M0+ micro-controller.  It has 256Kb of flash memory
and 32Kb of RAM.

This board is available [here](https://store.arduino.cc/product/GBX00003).

## Implementation Status

Notice that the initial support for the Arduino Zero was based on samr21-xpro
and Sodaq Autonomo.

Detailed information on the board can be found on [the official web page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero).

## Flashing the device

The standard method for flashing RIOT to the Arduino Zero is using OpenOCD.
For this to work properly, **you have to make sure to use a very recent version
of OpenOCD**.  Arduino-IDE comes with openocd v0.9.0  which is known to work.
Also Ubuntu 16.04 has openocd v0.9.0.

Refer to https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD for building OpenOCD
and make sure "cmsis-dap" and "hidapi-libusb" are enabled.

## Supported Toolchains

To build software for the Arduino Zero board we strongly recommend the usage
of the [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) toolchain.


## Known Issues / Problems

### Stack sizes
The default stack sizes have not been tuned properly yet. If in doubt why
your application crashes try increasing the default stack sizes and use `ps` to
find out how much stack is being used.
