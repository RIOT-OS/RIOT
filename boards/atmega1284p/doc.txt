@brief       Support for using the ATmega1284P as standalone board

## Overview

As the ATmega1284P can run from the internal oscillator, placing it on a
breadboard, connecting an USB-UART adapter and power is enough to run RIOT on
it. (An ISP programmer will be needed to program it; or to program a bootloader
to subsequently allow programming via UART.)

### Clock Frequency

The ATmega1284P has two internal oscillators clocked at 8MHz and at 128kHz that
allow it to be operated without any external clock source or crystal. By default
the fuses are configured to use the internal 8MHz oscillator, but the `CKDIV8`
fuse is set, so that the clock is divided down to 1MHz. By disabling the
`CKDIV8` fuse the clock will operate at 8MHz. This is highly encouraged, and
can be done with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
avrdude -c dragon_isp -p m1284p -B 32 -U lfuse:w:0xc2:m
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Replace `dragon_isp` with the programmer you are using. The -B 32 might be
needed for some programmers to successfully communicate with ATmegas clocked at
less than 2MHz. It will no longer be needed after disabling `CKDIV8`.)

By setting the environment variable `ATMEGA1284P_CLOCK` to a custom frequency in
Hz (e.g. `1000000` for 1MHz), this core clock can be changed easily. Refer to
the datasheet on how to configure the ATmega1284p to use an external crystal,
an external clock source or the clock divider.

### Relation Between Supply Voltage, Clock Frequency and Power Consumption

A higher supply voltage results in a higher current drawn. Thus, lower power
consumption can be achieved by using a lower supply voltage. However, higher
clock frequencies require higher supply voltages for reliable operation.

The lowest possible supply voltage at 8 MHz is 2.7V (with some safety margin).

## Flashing the Device

In order to flash the ATmega1284P without a bootloader, an ISP programmer is
needed. Connect the programmer as follows:

| ISCP pin | ATmega1284P    |
|:-------- |:-------------- |
| MISO     | 7/PB6/MISO     |
| VCC      | 10/VCC         |
| SCK      | 8/PB7/SCK      |
| MOSI     | 6/PB5/MOSI     |
| RESET    | 9/RESET        |
| Ground   | 11/GND         |

The tool `avrdude` needs to be installed. When using the AVR Dragon for
programming, running

    make BOARD=atmega1284p flash

will take care of everything. To use the programmer `<FOOBAR>` instead, run

    make BOARD=atmega1284p PROGRAMMER=<FOOBAR> flash

## Serial Terminal

Connect a TTL adapter with pins 14/RXD0 and 15/TXD0 an run

    make BOARD=atmega1284p term

Please note that the supply voltage should be compatible with the logic level of
the TTL adapter. Usually everything between 3.3 V and 5 V should work.
