 * @brief       Board specific definitions for generic ESP32-WROOM-32 boards
 * @{
 *
 * This configuration can be used for a large set of ESP32 boards that
 * use an ESP32-WROOM-32 module and simply break out all GPIOs to external
 * pads without having any special hardware or interfaces on-board.
 * Examples are Espressif's EPS32-DEVKIT or NodeMCU-ESP32S and a large
 * number of clones.
 *
 * For detailed information about the configuration of ESP32 boards, see
 * section \ref esp32_peripherals "Common Peripherals".
 *
 * @note
 * Most definitions can be overridden by an \ref esp32_application_specific_configurations
 * "application-specific board configuration".

 * the button signal is inverted, i.e., pressing the button will give a
 * low signal.
