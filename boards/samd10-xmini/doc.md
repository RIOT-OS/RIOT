### User Interface

1 User button and 1 LED:

| Device | PIN  |
|:------ |:---- |
| LED0   | PA09 |
| SW0    | PA25 |

## Flashing the device

Connect the device to your Micro-USB cable using the port labeled as *DEBUG
USB*.

The standard method for flashing RIOT to the samd10-xmini is using EDBG.

On Linux you will have to add a **udev** rule for hidraw, like
```
echo 'KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"' \
    | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb.rules
sudo service udev restart
```

Then you can flash the device as usual

```
make BOARD=samd10-xmini flash
```

## Known Issues / Problems

### I2C

The I2C pins on the board do not have any pull-ups connected to them.
That means that running e.g. `i2c_scan` without any I2C slaves connected
will run into timeouts.
