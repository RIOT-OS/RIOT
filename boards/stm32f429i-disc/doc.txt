 * @brief       Support for the `STM32F429-DISCO` and `STM32F429-DISC1` boards.




### Differences between -DISCO and -DISC1

The `DISC1` version of this board added the following USB features:

- Virtual COM port (UART)
- Mass storage
- ST-LINK/V2-B



### Using the -DISC1 variant

UART and flashing should work out of the box with this version of the board.



### Using the -DISCO variant

There's two additional things you'll need to do if your board is of the `-DISCO`
variant:

1. Set the environment variable `STLINK_VERSION=2` when flashing
2. Connect a USB-to-UART converter
	* On this board, `PA9` is the `TX` pin and `PA10` is the `RX` pin. Connect
	these two pins to the opposite pins on the USB-to-UART converter
	(e.g. `TX` to `RX`). Don't forget to also connect GND.
