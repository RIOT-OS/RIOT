@brief       Support for the Waspmote PRO v1.2 board.

## End of Life

@deprecated     Support for the Waspmote Pro is scheduled for removal after the
                2024-07 release.

This board is sold only B2B, so that our community members from the DIY/hobbyist
community and academia do not have access to the board. Our community members
from the industry mostly develop their own hardware and, therefore, have no
interest in supporting this board. As result, none of the RIOT core contributors
has access to the hardware, preventing us from doing the necessary testing
for maintaining this board.

## Pin Change Interrupts

More pins can be used for hardware interrupts using the Pin Change
Interrupt feature. See @ref boards_common_atmega for details.
