## Flashing the device

### Flashing the Board Using ST-LINK Removable Media

On-board ST-LINK programmer provides via composite USB device removable media.
Copying the HEX file causes reprogramming of the board. This task
could be performed manually; however, the cpy2remed (copy to removable
media) PROGRAMMER script does this automatically. To program board in
this manner, use the command:
```
make BOARD=nucleo-f429zi PROGRAMMER=cpy2remed flash
```
@note This PROGRAMMER requires ST-LINK firmware 2.37.26 or newer. Firmware updates
could be found on [this STM webpage](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

## Accessing RIOT shell

Default RIOT shell access utilize VCP (Virtual COM Port) via USB interface,
provided by integrated ST-LINK programmer. ST-LINK is connected to the
microcontroller USART3.

The default baud rate is 115200.

If a physical connection to USART3 is needed, connect UART interface to pins
PD8 (USART3 TX) and PD9 (USART3 RX).

@note Accordingly to the [MCU Datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f429zi.pdf)
PD8 and PD9 pins are 5V tolerant (see table 10, page 62).
