/**
 * @def         IS_ACTIVE(macro)
 * @brief       Allows to verify a macro definition outside the preprocessor.
 *
 * @details     This macro is based on Linux's clever 'IS_BUILTIN'
 *              (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/kconfig.h).
 *              It takes a @p macro value that may be defined to 1 or not even
 *              defined (e.g. FEATURE_FOO) and then expands it to an expression
 *              that can be used in C code, either 1 or 0.
 *
 *              The advantage of using this is that the compiler sees all the
 *              code, so checks can be performed, sections that would not be
 *              executed are removed during optimization. For example:
 * ```
 * if (IS_ACTIVE(FEATURE_FOO)) {
 *      do_something();
 * }
 * ```
 * @param[in]   macro   Macro to evaluate
 * @returns     1 if the macro is defined to 1
 * @returns     0 if the macro is not defined, of if it is defined to something
 *              else than 1.
 *
 * @note        This should only be used when macros are defined as 1, it will
 *              not work if the macro value is, for example, (1) or 1U.
 *
 * @note        Although this may seem to work similarly to the preprocessor's
 *              'defined', it is not entirely equal. If the given macro has
 *              been defined with no value, this will expand to 0. Also note
 *              that this is intended to be used with 'boolean' macros that act
 *              as switches, and usually will be defined as 1 or not defined.
