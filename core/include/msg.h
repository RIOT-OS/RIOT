 * @brief       Messaging API for inter process communication
 *
 * There are two ways to use the IPC Messaging system of RIOT. The default is
 * synchronous messaging. In this manner, messages are either dropped when the
 * receiver is not waiting and the message was sent non-blocking, or will be
 * delivered immediately when the receiver calls msg_receive(msg_t* m). To use
 * asynchronous messaging any thread can create its own queue by calling
 * msg_init_queue(msg_t* array, int num). Messages sent to a thread with a non
 * full message queue are never dropped * and the sending never blocks. Threads
 * with a full message queue behaves like in synchronous mode.
