 * @brief       Messaging API for inter process communication
 *
 * There are two ways to use the IPC Messaging system of RIOT. The default is synchronous
 * messaging. In this manner, messages are either dropped when the receiver is not waiting and the
 * message was sent non-blocking, or will be delivered immediately when the receiver calls
 * msg_receive(msg_t* m). To use asynchronous messaging any thread can create its own queue by
 * calling msg_init_queue(msg_t* array, int num). Messages sent to a thread with a non full message
 * queue are never dropped and the sending never blocks. Threads with a full message queue behaves
 * like in synchronous mode.
