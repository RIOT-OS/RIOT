/**
 * @defgroup    core_sched Scheduler
 * @ingroup     core
 * @brief       The RIOT scheduler
 * @details
 *
 * RIOT features a tickless, preemptive, priority based scheduler.
 * Context switches can occur either preemptively (i.e. on interrupts),
 * voluntarily, or when a blocking operation (like `msg_receive()`) is
 * executed.
 * Being tickless means it does not have a timer that fires
 * periodically in order to emulate concurrent execution by switching
 * threads continuously.
 *
 * ## Priorities:
 *
 * Every thread is given a priority on creation. The priority values
 * are "order" or "nice" values, i.e. a higher value means a lower
 * priority.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * Given threads with priorities A=6, B=1, and C=3, B has the highest
 * priority.
 *
 * A higher priority means that the scheduler will run this thread
 * whenever it becomes runnable instead of a thread with a lower
 * priority.
 * In case of equal priorities, the threads are scheduled in a
 * semi-cooperative fashion. That means that unless an interrupt
 * happens, threads with the same priority will only switch due to
 * voluntary or implicit context switches.
 *
 * ## Interrupts:
 *
 * When an interrupt occurs, e.g. because a timer fired or a network
 * packet was received, the active context is saved and an interrupt
 * service routine (ISR) that handles the interrupt is executed in
 * another context.
 * When the ISR is finished, the `::sched_context_switch_request` flag
 * can be checked. In case it is set, the `sched_run()` function is
 * called to determine the next active thread. (In the special case
 * that the ISR knows that it can not enable a thread switch, this
 * check can of course be omitted.)
 * If the flag is not set, the original context is being restored and
 * the thread resumes immediately.
 *
 * ## Voluntary Context Switches:
 *
 * There are two function calls that can lead to a voluntary context
 * switch: `thread_yield()` and `thread_sleep()`.
 * While the latter disables (think blocks) the thread until it is
 * woken (think unblocked) again via `thread_wakeup()`, the former only
 * leads to a context switch in case there is another runnable thread
 * with at least the same priority.
 *
 * ## Implicit Context Switches:
 *
 * Some functions that unblock another thread, e.g. `msg_send()` or
 * `mutex_unlock()`, can cause a thread switch, if the target had a
 * higher priority.
