 * @file
 * @brief       Thread flags API
 *
 * This API can be used to notify threads of conditions in a race-free
 * and allocation-less way.
 *
 * Each thread can handle up to 16 boolean flags, stored as a bitmask in the
 * flags field of its thread.  Those flags can be set or unset, using
 * thread_flags_set(), from ISR's, other threads or even by the thread itself.
 *
 * A thread can wait for any combination of its flags to become set, using
 * thread_flags_wait_any() or thread_flags_wait_all().
 * Those functions clear flags that caused them to return.
 * It is not possible to wait for flags to become unset.
 *
 * Thread flags have certain properties that make them the preferred choice
 * over messages or mutexes in some circumstances:
 *
 * - setting thread flags cannot fail
 *   If messages are used to notify a thread of a condition from within an ISR,
 *   and the receiving thread is not waiting, has no queue or the queue is
 *   full, the ISR cannot deliver the message. A thread flag can always be set.
 *
 * - thread flags are very flexible
 *   With thread flags it is possible to wait for multiple conditions and
 *   messages at the same time. When mutexes are used to notify about events,
 *   only one event can be waited for.
 *
 * Usually, if it is only of interest that an event occurred, but not how many
 * of them, thread flags should be considered.
 *
 * Note that some flags (currently the three most significant bits) are used by
 * core functions and should not be set by the user. They can be waited for.
