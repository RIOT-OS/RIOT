/**
 * @brief    abort the program if assertion is false
 *
 * If the macro NDEBUG was defined at the moment <assert.h> was last included,
 * the macro assert() generates no code, and hence does nothing at all.
 *
 * Otherwise, the macro assert() prints an error message to standard error and
 * terminates the application by calling core_panic().
 *
 * The purpose of this macro is to help programmers find bugs in their
 * programs.
 *
 * If `NDEBUG` is not defined, a failed assertion generates output similar to:
 *
 *     0x89abcdef
 *     *** RIOT kernel panic:
 *     FAILED ASSERTION.
 *
 *     ...
 *
 * Where 0x89abcdef is an address. This address can be used with tools like
 * `addr2line` (or e.g. `arm-none-eabi-addr2line` for ARM-based code), `objdump`,
 * or `gdb` (with the command `info line *(0x89abcdef)`) to identify the line
 * the assertion failed in.
