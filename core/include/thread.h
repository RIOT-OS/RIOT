/**
 * @brief Creates a new thread
 *
 * Creating a new thread is done in two steps:
 * 1. the new thread's stack is initialized depending on the platform
 * 2. the new thread is added to the scheduler to be run
 *
 * As RIOT is using a fixed priority scheduling algorithm, threads
 * are scheduled base on their priority. The priority is fixed for every thread
 * and specified during the threads creation by the *priority* parameter.
 *
 * A low value for *priority* number means the thread having a high priority
 * with 0 being the highest possible priority.
 *
 * The lowest possible priority is *PRIORITY_IDLE - 1*. The value is depending
 * on the platforms architecture, e.g. 30 in 32-bit systems, 14 in 16-bit systems.
 *
 *
 * In addition to the priority, the *flags* argument can be used to alter the
 * newly created threads behavior after creation. The following flags are available:
 *  - CREATE_SLEEPING       the newly created thread will be put to sleeping state and
 *                          must be waken up manually
 *  - CREATE_WOUT_YIELD     the newly created thread will not run immediately after creation
 *  - CREATE_STACKTEST      write markers into the thread's stack to measure the stack's memory
 *                          usage (for debugging and profiling purposes)
 *
 * @param[out] stack    start address of the preallocated stack memory
 * @param[in] stacksize the size of the thread's stack in bytes
 * @param[in] priority  priority of the new thread, lower mean higher priority
 * @param[in] flags     optional flags for the creation of the new thread
 * @param[in] task_func pointer to the code that is executed in the new thread
 * @param[in] arg       the argument to the function
 * @param[in] name      a human readable descriptor for the thread
 *
 * @return              value ``<0`` on error
 * @return              pid of newly created task, otherwise
