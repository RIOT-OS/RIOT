 * @ingroup     core
 * @brief       Support for multi-threading
 *
 * Priorities
 * ==========
 *
 * As RIOT is using a fixed priority @ref core_sched "scheduling algorithm",
 * threads are scheduled based on their priority. The priority is fixed for
 * every thread and specified during the thread's creation by the `priority`
 * parameter.
 *
 * The lower the priority value, the higher the priority of the thread,
 * with 0 being the highest possible priority.
 *
 * The lowest possible priority is @ref THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE - 1.
 *
 * @note Assigning the same priority to two or more threads is usually not a
 *       good idea. A thread in RIOT may run until it yields (@ref
 *       thread_yield) or another thread with higher priority is runnable (@ref
 *       STATUS_ON_RUNQUEUE) again. Multiple threads with the same priority
 *       will therefore be scheduled cooperatively: when one of them is running,
 *       all others with the same priority depend on it to yield (or be interrupted
 *       by a thread with higher priority).
 *       This may make it difficult to determine when which of them gets
 *       scheduled and how much CPU time they will get. In most applications,
 *       the number of threads in application is significantly smaller than the
 *       number of available priorities, so assigning distinct priorities per
 *       thread should not be a problem. Only assign the same priority to
 *       multiple threads if you know what you are doing!
 *
 * Thread Behavior
 * ===============
 * In addition to the priority, flags can be used when creating a thread to
 * alter the thread's behavior after creation. The following flags are available:
 *
 *  Flags                         | Description
 *  ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 *  @ref THREAD_CREATE_SLEEPING   | the thread will sleep until woken up manually
 *  @ref THREAD_CREATE_WOUT_YIELD | the thread might not run immediately after creation
 *  @ref THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST  | measures the stack's memory usage
 *
 * Thread creation
 * ===============
 * Creating a new thread is internally done in two steps:
 * 1. the new thread's stack is initialized depending on the platform
 * 2. the new thread is added to the scheduler and the scheduler is run (if not
 *    indicated otherwise)
 *
 * @note Creating threads from within an ISR is currently supported, however it
 *       is considered to be a bad programming practice and we strongly
 *       discourage you from doing so.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * #include "thread.h"
 *
 * char rcv_thread_stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];
 *
 * void *rcv_thread(void *arg)
 * {
 *     (void) arg;
 *     msg_t m;
 *
 *     while (1) {
 *         msg_receive(&m);
 *         printf("Got msg from %" PRIkernel_pid "\n", m.sender_pid);
 *     }
 *
 *     return NULL;
 * }
 *
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *     thread_create(rcv_thread_stack, sizeof(rcv_thread_stack),
 *                   THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST,
 *                   rcv_thread, NULL, "rcv_thread");
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Reading from the top down, you can see that first, stack memory for our thread
 * `rcv_thread` is preallocated, followed by an implementation of the thread's
 * function. Communication between threads is done using @ref core_msg. In this
 * case, `rcv_thread` will print the process id of each thread that sent a
 * message to `rcv_thread`.
 *
 * After it has been properly defined, `rcv_thread` is created with a call to
 * @ref thread_create() in `main()`. It is assigned a priority of
 * `THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1`, i.e. a slightly *higher* priority than the main
 * thread. Since neither the `THREAD_CREATE_SLEEPING` nor the
 * `THREAD_CREATE_WOUT_YIELD` flag is set, `rcv_thread` will be executed
 * immediately.
 *
 * @note If the messages to the thread are sent using @ref msg_try_send() or
 *       from an ISR, activate your thread's message queue by calling
 *       @ref msg_init_queue() to prevent messages from being dropped when
 *       they can't be handled right away. The same applies if you'd like
 *       msg_send() to your thread to be non-blocking. For more details, see
 *       @ref core_msg "the Messaging documentation".
