 *
 * @note    This function is considered internal. Out of tree users should be

 *
 * @pre     @p mc is used to cancel at most one call to
 *          @ref mutex_lock_cancelable. (You can reinitialize the same memory
 *          to safely reuse it.)
 * @warning You ***MUST NOT*** call this function once the thread referred to by
 *          @p mc reuses the mutex object referred to by @p mc (not counting
 *          the call to @ref mutex_lock_cancelable @p mc was used in).
 * @note    It is safe to call this function from IRQ context, e.g. from a timer
 *          interrupt.
 * @note    It is safe to call this function more than once on the same @p mc
 *          while it is still valid (see the warning above). The first call will
 *          cancel the operation and subsequent calls will have no effect.
 *
 * @details If @p thread is currently running (or pending), a subsequent call
 *          from @p thread to @ref mutex_lock_cancelable will also fail
 *
 * Canonical use:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * static void timeout_cb(void *arg) {
 *     mutex_cancel(arg);
 * }
 *
 * int ztimer_mutex_lock_timeout(ztimer_clock_t *clock, mutex_t *mutex,
 *                               uint32_t timeout)
 * {
 *     mutex_cancel_t mc = mutex_cancel_init(mutex);
 *     ztimer_t t = { .callback = timeout_cb, .arg = &mc };
 *     ztimer_set(clock, &t, timeout);
 *     if (mutex_lock_cancelable(&mc)) {
 *         return -ECANCELED;
 *     }
 *     ztimer_remove(clock, &t);
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * In the above example a simple implementation of how to implement mutex
 * locking with a timeout is given. There are two corner cases:
 *
 * 1. The call to @ref mutex_cancel could occur *before* the call to
 *    @ref mutex_lock_cancelable. (E.g. for `timeout == 0`.)
 * 2. The call to @ref mutex_cancel could occur right after the mutex was
 *    *successfully* obtained, but before `ztimer_remove()` was executed.
 *
 * In the first corner case the cancellation is stored in @p mc. Hence, the
 * subsequent call to @ref mutex_lock_cancelable gets indeed canceled. In the
 * second corner case the cancellation is also stored in @p mc but never used -
 * the mutex cancellation structure @p mc is not allowed to be reused without
 * reinitialization.
