 * @warning     By default, no mitigation against priority inversion is
 *              employed. If your application is subject to priority inversion
 *              and cannot tolerate the additional delay this can cause, use
 *              module `core_mutex_priority_inheritance` to employ
 *              priority inheritance as mitigation.
 *
 * Mutex Implementation Basics
 * ===========================
 *
 * Data Structures and Encoding
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * A `mutex_t` contains basically a point, which can have one of the following
 * values:
 *
 * 1. `NULL`, in case it is unlocked
 * 2. `MUTEX_LOCKED` in case it is locked, but no other thread is waiting on it
 * 3. A pointer to the head of single linked list of threads (or more precisely
 *    their `thread_t` structures) blocked waiting for obtaining the mutex. This
 *    list is terminated by `NULL`, not by `MUTEX_LOCKED`
 *
 * The same information graphically:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Unlocked mutex:
 * +-------+
 * | Mutex | --> NULL
 * +-------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, no waiters:
 * +-------+
 * | Mutex | --> MUTEX_LOCKED
 * +-------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, one waiter:
 * +-------+     +--------+
 * | Mutex | --> | Waiter | --> NULL
 * +-------+     +--------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, 2 waiters:
 * +-------+     +--------+     +--------+
 * | Mutex | --> | Waiter | --> | Waiter | --> NULL
 * +-------+     +--------+     +--------+
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Obtaining a Mutex
 * -----------------
 *
 * If a `mutex_lock()` is called, one of the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If the mutex was unlocked (value of `NULL`), its value is changed to
 *    `MUTEX_LOCKED` and the call to `mutex_lock()` returns right away without
 *    blocking.
 * 2. If the mutex has a value of `MUTEX_LOCKED`, it will be changed to point to
 *    the `thread_t` of the running thread. The single item list is terminated
 *    by setting the `thread_t::rq_entry.next` of the running thread to `NULL`.
 *    The running thread blocks as described below.
 * 3. Otherwise, the current thread is inserted into the list of waiting
 *    threads sorted by thread priority. The running thread blocks as described
 *    below.
 *
 * In case 2) and 3), the running thread will mark itself as blocked (waiting
 * for a mutex) and yields. Once control is transferred back to this thread
 * (which is done in the call to `mutex_unlock()`), it has the mutex and the
 * function `mutex_lock()` returns.
 *
 * Returning a Mutex
 * -----------------
 *
 * If `mutex_unlock()` is called, one of the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If the mutex was already unlocked (value of `NULL`), the call returns
 *    without modifying the mutex.
 * 2. If the mutex was locked without waiters (value of `MUTEX_LOCKED`), it is
 *    unlocked by setting its value to `NULL`.
 * 3. Otherwise the first `thread_t` from the linked list of waiters is removed
 *    from the list.
 *     - This thread is the one with the highest priority, as the list is sorted
 *       by priority.
 *     - This thread's status is set to pending and its added to the appropriate
 *       run queue.
 *     - If that thread was the last item in the list, the mutex is set to
 *       `MUTEX_LOCK`.
 *     - The scheduler is run, so that if the unblocked waiting thread can
 *       run now, in case it has a higher priority than the running thread.
 *
 * Debugging deadlocks
 * -------------------
 *
 * The module `core_mutex_debug` can be used to print on whom `mutex_lock()`
 * is waiting. This information includes the thread ID of the owner and the
 * program counter (PC) from where `mutex_lock()` was called. Note that the
 * information is only valid if:
 *
 * - The mutex was locked by a thread, and not e.g. by `MUTEX_INIT_LOCKED`
 * - The function `cpu_get_caller_pc()` is implemented for the target
 *   architecture. (The thread ID will remain valid, though.)
 * - The caller PC is briefly 0 when the current owner passes over ownership
 *   to the next thread, but that thread didn't get CPU time yet to write its
 *   PC into the data structure. Even worse, on architectures where an aligned
 *   function-pointer-sized write is not atomic, the value may briefly be
 *   bogus. Chances are close to zero this ever hits and since this only
 *   effects debug output, the ostrich algorithm was chosen here.

 *          cancel the operation and subsequent calls will have no effect.

 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * static void timeout_cb(void *arg) {
 *     mutex_cancel(arg);
 * }
 *
 * int ztimer_mutex_lock_timeout(ztimer_clock_t *clock, mutex_t *mutex,

 *
 * In the above example a simple implementation of how to implement mutex
 * locking with a timeout is given. There are two corner cases:
 *
 * 1. The call to @ref mutex_cancel could occur *before* the call to
 *    @ref mutex_lock_cancelable. (E.g. for `timeout == 0`.)
 * 2. The call to @ref mutex_cancel could occur right after the mutex was
 *    *successfully* obtained, but before `ztimer_remove()` was executed.
 *
 * In the first corner case the cancellation is stored in @p mc. Hence, the
 * subsequent call to @ref mutex_lock_cancelable gets indeed canceled. In the
 * second corner case the cancellation is also stored in @p mc but never used -
 * the mutex cancellation structure @p mc is not allowed to be reused without
 * reinitialization.
