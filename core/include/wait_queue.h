 * @ingroup     core_sync
 * @brief       Linux-like wait queue for condition signaling
 *
 * Wait queues enable lock-free, IRQ-safe condition signaling. This
 * implementation is inspired from the Linux Kernel.
 *
 * Wait queues have similar semantics to condition variables, but don't require
 * setting the condition + signaling to be atomic, hence no mutex is needed. In
 * turn, one may safely call queue_wake() from an ISR. Note, while cond_signal()
 * and cond_broadcast() are safe to call from an ISR context too, doing so will
 * very probably cause a race condition elsewhere. Consider the following
 * scenario using condition variables:
 *
 * ```
 * static uint64_t measurement;
 * mutex_t cond_lock = MUTEX_INIT;
 * cond_t cond = COND_INIT;
 *
 * void measurement_irq(void)
 * {
 *     measurement = measure();
 *     cond_broadcast(&cond);
 * }
 *
 * void wait_for_critical_value(void)
 * {
 *     mutex_lock(&cond_lock);
 *     while (atomic_load_u64(&measurement) < THRESHOLD) {
 *         cond_wait(&cond, cond_lock);
 *     }
 *     mutex_unlock(&cond_lock);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note, the mutex is there only for the cond_wait() API call, as we're not
 * allowed to call mutex_lock() inside the ISR. This alone is a hint that
 * something isn't right and indeed, the following sequence of events is
 * possible:
 *  1. thread sees measurement < THRESHOLD, and is about to call cond_wait()
 *  2. ISR fires, sets measurement = THRESHOLD, and signals the condition
 *  3. thread calls cond_wait() and goes to sleep, possibly forever
 *
 * Using a wait queue, we can do this:
 *
 * ```
 * static uint64_t measurement;
 * wait_queue_t wq = WAIT_QUEUE_INIT;
 *
 * void measurement_irq(void)
 * {
 *     measurement = measure();
 *     queue_wake(&wq);
 * }
 *
 * void wait_for_critical_value(void)
 * {
 *     QUEUE_WAIT(&wq, atomic_load_u64(&measurement) >= THRESHOLD);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This is free of the race condition above because QUEUE_WAIT() is a macro
 * that checks the condition AFTER queueing the current thread to be waken up.
 *
 * When to use?
 *
 * QUEUE_WAIT() is a macro and might come with some additional code size cost
 * due to inlining. If you're not synchronizing with an ISR and care very much
 * about code size then go for condition variables, otherwise there is no
 * reason not to use the wait queue.
 *
 * Can't I just use a mutex?
 *
 * You can abuse a mutex by locking it in a loop in the thread context and
 * unlocking from the ISR context. But this will only work for a single waiter
 * and makes improper use of the mutex semantics.
