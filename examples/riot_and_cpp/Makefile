BOARD ?= native

# This has to be the absolute path to the RIOT base directory:
RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../..

# Uncomment these lines if you want to use platform support from external
# repositories:
#RIOTCPU ?= $(CURDIR)/../../../thirdparty_cpu
#RIOTBOARD ?= $(CURDIR)/../../../thirdparty_boards

# Uncomment this to enable scheduler statistics for ps:
#CFLAGS += -DSCHEDSTATISTICS

# If you want to use native with valgrind, you should recompile native
# with the target all-valgrind instead of all:
# make -B clean all-valgrind

# Comment this out to disable code in RIOT that does safety checking
# which is not needed in a production environment but helps in the
# development process:
CFLAGS += -DDEVELHELP

# Change this to 0 show compiler invocation lines by default:
