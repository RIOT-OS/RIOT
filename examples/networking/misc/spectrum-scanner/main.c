/**
 * @brief Measure the radio energy spectrum and print on stdout
 *
 * Algorithm description:
 *
 * The process will repeat as many measurements as possible during the
 * measurement interval, before the average power is computed. This reduces the
 * noise in the measurement and will yield a better image of what the radio
 * environment contains.
 *
 * Still, 122 measurements per second (frdm-kw41z) and 128 us per measurement
 * will only give a time coverage of about 1.5%, but because the measurements are
 * spread out over time they should still give a good representation of which
 * channels are free.
 *
 * Note that because the ED values are given in decibels, the average radio
 * power is not the same as the arithmetic mean of the ED measurements. To
 * compute the average of the dB measurements this algorithm requires both
 * logarithm and exponentiation, quite heavy operations on the kinds of CPUs
 * that RIOT targets. Increasing the CPU clock frequency may therefore reduce
 * the noise in the output, because of the more frequent energy measurements
 * possible.
