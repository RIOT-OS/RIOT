GPIO
=======

This is a basic example that toggles the value of a given GPIO pin.
The user interface is through the `toggle <pin_number>` shell command.
Example usage:

```bash
> toggle 26
```

This is mostly useful for beginners who are to starting to experiment with
RIOT and may want to test the GPIO interface.
