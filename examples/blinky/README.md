Blinky!
=======

This is a basic example that blinks an LED, if available. (If no LED is present or configured, it
will print "Blink!" via stdio instead.)

This is mostly useful for boards without stdio to check if a new port of RIOT works. For that
reason, this example has only an optional dependency on timer drivers. Hence, this application only
needs a working GPIO driver and is likely the first milestone when porting RIOT to new MCUs.
