THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE

If you find bugs please contact support@wolfssl.com

These are the steps to properly setup a test of wolfssl in RIOT OS:

clone wolfssl one directory up from this example.
You should end up with RIOT/examples/security/wolfssl

git clone https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl

run the script ./wolf-build-and-run-test.sh

That script will perform the following steps:
1. copy the source files from:
    <wolfssl-root>/src
    <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/src
    <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/test

2. The script will use the provided Makefile to build the example application:
    "testwolfcrypt.elf"
    This application will be located here:
    <path-to>/RIOT/examples/security/crypto-test/bin/native/testwolfcrypt.elf

3. The script will execute that application. You should see a pass or fail.

4. Lastly that script will cleanup the source files it copied in for building.
   To disable this step run the script with --no-cleanup flag IE:

    ./wolf-build-and-run-test.sh --no-cleanup

    NOTE: the cleanup is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED when doing development to prevent
            making changes on temporary files.
            All development changes should be made to the actual source
            files located in their respective directories:
            <wolfssl-root>/src
            <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/src
            <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/benchmark
            Then the script "wolf-build-and-run-test.sh" should be run again to
            test those changes
            If you do make changes in this directory, they will not be tracked
            by GIT

NOTE: This test is only for the "native" test. To build for a specific platform
        cd to RIOT directory and run "make doc" to generate doxygen docs.
        (You will need to install doxygen if you don't have it already)
        Then open the file: RIOT/doc/doxygen/html/index.html

        This will provide you with the necessary help to setup and build for a
        specific platform

KNOWN BUGS:

1. To buid with gcc instead of clang, you have to edit RIOT/Makefile.cflags and
   comment out the -Wold-style-definitions section that starts with:
   "Fast-out on old style function definitions"
