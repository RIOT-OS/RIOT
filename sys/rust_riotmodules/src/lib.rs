// Crates in here are pub used in case they make anything accessible to Rust applications directly;
// they can then access the crates as `rust_riotmodules::lsm303agr` or similar.
//
// (Also, if they were not pub used, they'd need to be extern crate'd).

// This list should be as auto-generated / -maintained as the one in Cargo.toml
