# By having this explicit feature (comapred to what is enabled by the build
# system as `--features rust_riotmodules/foo`), all possible dependencies are
# visible to `cargo update` and in `Cargo.lock. This should not be enabled for
# compilation, as the modules behind it likely have their own RIOT modules they
# need enabled.
