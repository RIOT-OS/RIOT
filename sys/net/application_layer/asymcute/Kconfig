config ASYMCUTE_DEFAULT_PORT
    int "Default UDP port to listen on"
    default 1883
    help
        Default UDP port to listen on (also used as SRC port). This will write
        to macro 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_DEFAULT_PORT'. Usage can be found in
        examples/asymcute_mqttsn

config ASYMCUTE_BUFSIZE
    int "Size of buffer used for receive and request buffers"
    default 128

config ASYMCUTE_TOPIC_MAXLEN
    int "Maximum topic length"
    default 32
    help
        Configure maximum length for clients topic. The value must be less than
        (256 - 8) and less than ('CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_BUFSIZE' - 8).

config ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE
    int "Keep alive interval in seconds"
    range 300 $(UINT32_MAX)
    default 360
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE', keep alive interval in seconds
        which is communicated to the gateway in the CONNECT message. For more
        information, see MQTT-SN Spec v1.2, section 5.4.4. For default values,
        see section 7.2 -> TWAIT: > 5 min. Default value is 360 seconds which
        corresponds to 6 minutes.

config ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING_EN
    bool "Enable configuration of keep alive ping"
    help
        Enable configuration of 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING', keep alive
        ping interval. If not enabled, 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING' will
        default to three quarters of 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE', keep alive
        interval.

config ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING
    int "Keep alive ping interval in seconds"
    default 270
    depends on ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING_EN
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE_PING', interval used by client for
        sending periodic keep alive ping messages to the gateway. The value must
        be less than 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_KEEPALIVE'.

config ASYMCUTE_T_RETRY
    int "Retry timer in seconds"
    range 10 15
    default 10
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_T_RETRY', interval used for timing the retry
        messages which are sent when the expected reply from GW is not received.
        The retry timer is started by the client when the message is sent and
        stopped when the expected reply from GW is received. If the timer times
        out and the expected GW’s reply is not received, the client retransmits
        the message. For more information, see MQTT-SN Spec v1.2, section 6.13.
        For default values, see section 7.2 -> Tretry: 10 to 15 sec.

config ASYMCUTE_N_RETRY
    int "Maximum number of retransmissions"
    range 3 5
    default 3
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_N_RETRY',the maximum number of retransmissions
        in the event that the retry timer times out. After 'CONFIG_ASYMCUTE_N_RETRY'
        number of retransmissions, the client aborts the procedure and assumes
        that its MQTT-SN connection to the gateway is disconnected. For more
        information, see MQTT-SN Spec v1.2, section 6.13. For default values,
        see section 7.2 -> Nretry: 3-5.
