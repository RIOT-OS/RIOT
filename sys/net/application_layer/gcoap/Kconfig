    range 1 3
    help
        This width, expressed in bytes, is used to determine the length of the
        'tick' used to measure the time between observable changes to a
        resource. A tick is expressed internally as GCOAP_OBS_TICK_EXPONENT,
        which is the base 2 log value of the tick length in microseconds.

        The canonical setting for the value is 3 (exponent 5), which results in
        a tick length of 32 usec, per sec. 3.4, 4.4 of the RFC. Width 2
        (exponent 16) results in a tick length of ~64 msec, and width 1
        (exponent 24) results in a tick length of ~17 sec.

        The tick length must be short enough so that the Observe value strictly
        increases for each new notification. The purpose of the value is to
        allow a client to detect message reordering withing the network latency
        period (128 sec). For resources that change slowly, the reduced
        message length is useful when packet size is limited.
