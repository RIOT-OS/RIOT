        Configure the GNRC_PKTBUF using Kconfig.

        Set the value to 0 to allow dynamic memory management to allocate
        packets. The rational here is to have enough space for 4 full-MTU IPv6
        packets (2 incoming, 2 outgoing; 2 * 2 * 1280 B = 5 KiB) + Meta-Data
        (roughly estimated to 1 KiB; might be smaller).
