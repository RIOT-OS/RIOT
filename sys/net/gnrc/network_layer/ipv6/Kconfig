        Configure GNRC IPv6 module using Kconfig.

config GNRC_IPV6_MSG_QUEUE_SIZE_EXP
    int "Exponent for the message queue size used for the IPv6 thread (as 2^n)"
    default 3
    help
        As the queue size ALWAYS needs to be power of two, this option
        represents the exponent of 2^n, which will be used as the size of
        the queue.

config GNRC_IPV6_STATIC_LLADDR_ENABLE
    bool "Add a static IPv6 link local address to any network interface"
    help
         This allows to specify a certain link local IPv6 address to be assigned
         to a network interface on startup, which might be handy for testing.

         A interface will keep its auto-generated link local address, too.

config GNRC_IPV6_STATIC_LLADDR
    string "Static link-local address"
    depends on GNRC_IPV6_STATIC_LLADDR_ENABLE
    default "fe80::cafe:cafe:cafe:1"
    help
         The address is configured on each interface and incremented by the
         interface PID.

config GNRC_IPV6_STATIC_LLADDR_IS_FIXED
    bool "Same link-local address on every interface"
    depends on GNRC_IPV6_STATIC_LLADDR_ENABLE
    help
         Don't add the interface PID to the least significant byte
         of the address.
