        Configure GNRC IPv6 fragmentation and reassembly via Kconfig.

        This limits the total amount of datagrams that can be fragmented at
        the same time.

        the same time.

        Number of total allocable gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag_limits_t objects. This is
        the maximum number of receivable fragments, shared between all
        fragmented datagrams.

        This value is expressed in microseconds.

        When not set, it will cause the reassembly buffer to override the oldest
        entry when a fragment for a new datagram is received. When set to 1, no
        entry will be overwritten (they will still timeout normally)
