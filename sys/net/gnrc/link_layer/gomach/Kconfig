config GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US
    int "Wake-up period (WP) duration in microseconds"
    default 10000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US'. GoMacH adopts the
        duty-cycle scheme that, by default, a node only wakes up for a short
        period of 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US' in each cycle. In the
        rest of the cycle (except vTDMA), the node turns off the radio  to
        conserve power. 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US' should be at least
        longer than 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_PREAM_INTERVAL_US', thus to
        guarantee that the receiver will not miss the preamble packet.

config GNRC_GOMACH_SUPERFRAME_DURATION_US
    int "Duration of superframe in microseconds"
    default 300000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_SUPERFRAME_DURATION_US' ,superframe
        duration, i.e , time between two consecutive wake-ups.
        The configurations should not be shorter than 10 times of
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US' and not shorter than the RTT tickle
        interval.This configuration governs power consumption and GoMacHs
        reactiveness to traffic loads.In GoMacH, nodes adopt duty-cycle scheme
        to conserve power. That is, time is divided into repeated cycles
        (superframes), and in each cycle, a node only wakes up for a short
        period of time for receiving potential incoming packets for itself.
        This configuration defines the wake-up interval, or, in other words,
        defines the cycle duration used in GoMacH. For more information refer
        file 'gomach.h' in sys/include/net/gnrc.

config GNRC_GOMACH_CP_RANDOM_END_US
    int "Duration of random period at the end of WP in microseconds"
    default 1000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_RANDOM_END_US', the maximum duration
        of the random period at the end of GoMacH's wake-up period (WP).
        Currently, GoMacH's WP is composed of
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_DURATION_US' and (+)
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_RANDOM_END_US'. This random was introduced
        to avoid beacon collision among neighbor nodes. This configuration may
        be removed in the future.

config GNRC_GOMACH_CP_MIN_GAP_US
    int "Time interval between neighbor nodes' Wake-up phases in microseconds"
    default 25000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_MIN_GAP_US', the minimum gap between
        neighbor nodes' wake-up phases in GoMacH.To reduce beacon collisions
        and transmission collisions, GoMacH intends to avoid neighbor nodes'
        phases  being too close to each other. This configuration defines the
        minimum gap between two nodes's wake-up phases. If the sender finds its
        wake-up phase too closed to its receiver's, it will randomly select a
        new phase for itself.

config GNRC_GOMACH_WAIT_RX_END_US
    int "Timeout for 'NETDEV_EVENT_RX_COMPLETE' in GoMacH in microseconds"
    default 6000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_WAIT_RX_END_US', the timeout duration for
        waiting 'NETDEV_EVENT_RX_COMPLETE' event in GoMacH. Sometimes in
        GoMacH, if a node finds RX ongoing when it is just about to enter the
        next MAC state, it will set up a timeout for waiting this packet
        reception complete with a timeout of this
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_WAIT_RX_END_US' duration.

config GNRC_GOMACH_NO_TX_ISR_US
    int "Timeout duration for confirming TX-No-ISR event in microseconds"
    default 50000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_NO_TX_ISR_US',the timeout duration for
        confirming TX-No-ISR event in GoMacH. This configuration is used to
        confirm/catch a case that a transmission doesnt have its
        'NETDEV_EVENT_TX_COMPLETE' interrupt event, which is considered as a
        hardware abnormal event. Upon this timeout expiration, GoMach will
        accordingly take actions to maintain its state-machine.

config GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_PREAM_INTERVAL_US
    int "Maximum time interval between two preamble packets in microseconds"
    default 6000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_PREAM_INTERVAL_US',the maximum time
        interval between two consecutive preamble packets in GoMacH. In GoMacH,
        a sender first uses preamble stream to track the receiver's wake-up
        phase (WP), if the receiver's WP is unknown. This configuration defines
        the maximum time interval between twoconsecutive preamble packets.

config GNRC_GOMACH_PREAMBLE_INTERVAL_US
    int "Time interval between two preamble packets in microseconds"
    default 2000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_PREAMBLE_INTERVAL_US', the time interval
        between two consecutive preamble packets in GoMacH. In GoMacH, after a
        preamble is sent, the sender sets a timeout with
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_PREAMBLE_INTERVAL_US' duration for waiting to send
        the next preamble. Notably, this configuration is with a very small
        value. In GoMacH, for receiving the preamble-ACK packet, the sender
        doesn't wait for the whole reception of the preamble-ACK. Instead, it
        only waits for the 'NETDEV_EVENT_RX_STARTED' event which leads to
        shorter time interval between two consecutive preamble transmissions.

config GNRC_GOMACH_BCAST_INTERVAL_US
    int "Time interval between two broadcast packets in microseconds"
    default 1000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_BCAST_INTERVAL_US', the time interval
        between two consecutive broadcast packets in GoMacH. In GoMacH, when
        sending a broadcast packet, the sender broadcasts the same packet frame
        on its two public channels simultaneously, with a total duration of
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_SUPERFRAME_DURATION_US' to guarantee that all
        neighbors will get a copy. This configuration defines the time interval
        between ending two consecutive broadcast copies.

config GNRC_GOMACH_VTDMA_SLOT_SIZE_US
    int "Transmission slot size in microseconds **Should not be changed**"
    default 5000
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_VTDMA_SLOT_SIZE_US', the transmission slot
        size in GoMacH. GoMacH adopts dynamic slots allocation scheme to
        allocate transmission slots to senders that have pending packets. Each
        slot is for one data packet with ACK transmission.
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_VTDMA_SLOT_SIZE_US' is right sufficient for the
        transmission of the longest packet in IEEE 802.15.4 with ACK. Should
        not be changed.

config GNRC_GOMACH_TX_BUSY_THRESHOLD
    int "Maximum number of CSMA TX attempts under busy-indication in the WP"
    default 5
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_TX_BUSY_THRESHOLD', maximum number of
        CSMA TX attempts under busy-indication in the WP period of the receiver.
        Senders in GoMacH adopt CSMA scheme to send data packets in the WP
        period of the receiver. In case of having medium-busy feedback in WP
        and the TX failure count (due to busy) is below
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_TX_BUSY_THRESHOLD', the sender continue to send the
        packet with CSMAin the receiver's WP, with the consideration that there
        may be multi-senders simultaneously competing in WP and the WP will be
        continuously extended (thus the packet can be received).

config GNRC_GOMACH_CP_EXTEND_THRESHOLD
    int "Maximum WP period extension number"
    default 5
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_CP_EXTEND_THRESHOLD', maximum WP period
        extension number in GoMacH. The WP period of a receiver will be
        extended upon each successful packet reception (except receiving
        broadcast or preamble packet) to receive more potential incoming
        packets.

config GNRC_GOMACH_RX_DUPCHK_UNIT_LIFE
    int "Life time of check-duplicate-packet in cycle count"
    default 30
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_RX_DUPCHK_UNIT_LIFE', GoMacHs
        check-duplicate-packet unit life time in cycle count. In GoMacH, to
        avoid receiving duplicate-packet, we currently introduce a data type of
        'gnrc_gomach_dupchk_unit_t' to record the recent senders information
        (especially MAC TX sequence). This configuration defines the
        check-duplicate-packet data units life time in cycle count. Once
        expired, the related data unit will be reset. This configuration maybe
        removed in the future.

config GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_ALLOC_SENDER_NUM
    int "Maximum number of senders allowed to be allocated slots in one cycle"
    default 11
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_ALLOC_SENDER_NUM', maximum number of
        senders allowed to be allocated slots in one cycle. Exclude the static
        GoMacH MAC header payload in the beacon, which is 20 bytes, we have 107
        bytes left for constructing the sender-ID list and the related
        slots-number list. A combined slots allocation information pair (sender
        ID with its corresponded allocate slots number) will cost 9 (8+1)
        bytes, thus we can hold a maximum of 11 i.e., ((127 - 20) / 9), sender
        IDs in the beacon.

config GNRC_GOMACH_REPHASELOCK_THRESHOLD
    int "Maximum number of t2k attempts before t2u"
    default 4
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_REPHASELOCK_THRESHOLD', maximum t2k
        attempts before going to t2u in GoMacH.After phase-locked with the
        receiver, a sender runs a t2k (transmit-to-known) procedure to transmit
        packet to the phase-known device. However, due to factors like timer
        driftor busy-channel, a transmission attempt may fail in t2k. If the
        t2k failure count has reached this
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_REPHASELOCK_THRESHOLD', the sender regards
        phase-locked failed due to timer drift. In this case, it will adopt t2u
        (transmit-to-unknown) procedure to get re-phase-locked with the
        receiver.

config GNRC_GOMACH_T2U_RETYR_THRESHOLD
    int "Maximum number of t2u attempts before dropping data packet"
    default 2
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_T2U_RETYR_THRESHOLD', maximum number of
        t2u attempts before dropping data packet in GoMacH. In case the
        receivers phase is unknown to the sender, the sender adopts the t2u
        (transmit-to-unknown) procedure to get phase-locked with the receiver.
        This configuration defines the maximum t2u attempts before dropping the
        data packet in GoMacH.

config GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_T2U_RETYR_THRESHOLD
    int "Maximum t2u attempts before re-initiating radio"
    default 10
    help
        Configure 'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_T2U_RETYR_THRESHOLD', maximum number
        of t2u attempts before re-initiaing radio in GoMacH. After a long
        period of run time, a radio may be in wrong condition which needs to be
        re-calibrated. This is indicated by having a series of continuous t2u
        failures (no preambleACK) in GoMacH. In case we have
        'CONFIG_GNRC_GOMACH_MAX_T2U_RETYR_THRESHOLD' number of t2u failures,
        then we re-initiate the radio, trying to re-calibrate the radio for
        bringing it back to normal condition.
