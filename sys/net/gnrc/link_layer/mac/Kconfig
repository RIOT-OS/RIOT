        As the queue size ALWAYS needs to be power of two, this option

        queue for incoming packets.

        As the buffer size ALWAYS needs to be power of two, this option
        represents the exponent of 2^n, which will be used as the size of the
        dispatch buffer for storing dispatching packets.
