config GNRC_NETIF_MSG_QUEUE_SIZE_EXP
    int "Exponent for the message queue size for network interface threads (as 2^n)"
    default 4
    help
        As the queue size ALWAYS needs to be power of two, this option
        represents the exponent of 2^n, which will be used as the size of
        the queue.

config GNRC_NETIF_IPV6_ADDRS_NUMOF
    int "Maximum number of unicast and anycast addresses per interface"
    default 2
    help
        If you change this, please make sure that
        @ref CONFIG_GNRC_NETIF_IPV6_GROUPS_NUMOF is also large enough to fit the
        addresses' solicited nodes multicast addresses.
        Default: 2 (1 link-local + 1 global address).

    int "Default hop limit"

    int "Minimum wait time after a send operation"

    help
        This value is expressed in microseconds. It is purely meant as a debugging
        feature to slow down a radios sending.

    bool "Enable usage of non standard MTU for 6LoWPAN network interfaces"
    depends on USEMODULE_GNRC_NETIF_6LO
    help
        Enables the usage of non standard MTU for 6LoWPAN network interfaces.
        This is non compliant with RFC 4944 and might not be supported by other
        implementations.

        Set to -1 to deactivate dequeing by timer. For this it has to be ensured
        that none of the notifications by the driver are missed!
