 * @brief       Basic general interface to communicate with a network protocol.
 * @details     The idea of this module is that every network layer provides
 *              a basic set of commands to communicate with its lower and
 *              upper layer and the system. In this model every layer has some
 *              sort of control thread with which the other layers and the system
 *              communicates (illustrated as cohesive boxes below).
