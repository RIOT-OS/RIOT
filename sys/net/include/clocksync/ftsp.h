/**
 * @defgroup ftsp FTSP (Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol)
 * @ingroup  net
 * The Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol is a clock synchronization protocol
 * which tries to synchronizes not only the clock values but also the clock rate
 * of all nodes in a network.
 *
 * The protocol builds an implicit spanning tree and synchronizes every node
 * to their root. Each node forwards synchronization information to their
 * children as soon as the node decides it is sufficiently synchronized
 * against its parent node.
