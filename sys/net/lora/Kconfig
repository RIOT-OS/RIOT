    help
        Configure preamble used in LoRa frame. Each LoRa frame begins with a
        preamble. It starts with a series of upchirps to cover the whole
        frequency band of the particular channel assigned. The last two upchirps
        encode the sync word. Sync word is used to differntiate between LoRa
        transmissions that use the same frequency bands. The sync word is
        followed by two and a quarter downchirps, for a duration of 2.25
        symbols. The total duration of this preamble can be configured between
        10.25 and 65,539.25 symbol hence the range 8 to 65537.

    help
        Configure Spreading Factor (SF). SF denotes the amount of spreading code
        applied to the original data signal. A larger SF increases the time on
        air, which increases energy consumption, reduces the data rate, and
        improves communication range. Each step up in spreading factor
        effectively doubles the time on air to transmit the same amount of data.
        Refer to country specific air time usage regulations before varying the
        SF. To calculate air time refer https://www.loratools.nl/#/airtime .

    bool "Coding rate"

    help
        Configure Coding rate (CR). CR denotes the implementation of forward
        error correction (FEC). This may be done by encoding 4-bit data with
        redundancies into 5-bit, 6-bit, 7-bit, or 8-bit. Coding Rate (CR) value
        need to be adjusted according to conditions of the channel used for data
        transmission. If there are too many interferences in the channel, then
        itâ€™s recommended to increase the value of CR. However, the rise in CR
        value will also increase the duration for the transmission. Refer to
        country specific air time usage regulations before varying the CR. To
        calculate air time refer https://www.loratools.nl/#/airtime .
