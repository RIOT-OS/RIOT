        This module provides wrappers for malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and
        free() which guarantee mutually exclusive access to heap data
        structures. This linker is also instructed to redirect all calls to
        the corresponding wrappers. As a result, all allocations become thread
        safe without touching the application code or the c library. This module
        is intended to be pulled in automatically if needed. Hence, applications
        never should manually use it.

    help
        This module enables hooks in the wrappers for malloc(), calloc(),
        realloc(), and free() provided by MODULE_MALLOC_THREAD_SAFE that print
        the arguments, caller program counter and return value of those
        functions. The intent is to aid debugging invalid calls to free(),
        duplicated calls to free(), or memory leaks.

        Note that generally dynamic memory management is a bad idea on the
        constrained devices RIOT is targeting. So maybe it is better to just
        adapt your code to  use static memory management instead.
