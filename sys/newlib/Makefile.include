# Search for Newlib include directories

# Since Clang is not installed as a separate instance for each crossdev target
# we need to tell it where to look for platform specific includes (Newlib
# headers instead of Linux/Glibc headers.)
# On GCC this is done when building the cross compiler toolchain so we do not
# actually need to specify the include paths for system includes.
# Ubuntu gcc-arm-embedded toolchain (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
# places newlib headers in several places, but the primary source seem to be
# /etc/alternatives/gcc-arm-none-eabi-include
# Gentoo Linux crossdev place the newlib headers in /usr/arm-none-eabi/include
# Arch Linux also place the newlib headers in /usr/arm-none-eabi/include
# Ubuntu seem to put a copy of the newlib headers in the same place as
# Gentoo crossdev, but we prefer to look at /etc/alternatives first.
# On OSX, newlib includes are possibly located in
# /usr/local/opt/arm-none-eabi*/arm-none-eabi/include
