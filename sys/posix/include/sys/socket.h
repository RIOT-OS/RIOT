/**
 * @brief   Create an endpoint for communication.
 * @details Shall create an unbound socket in a communications domain, and
 *          return a file descriptor that can be used in later function calls
 *          that operate on sockets.
 *
 * @param[in] domain    Specifies the communications domain in which a socket
 *                      is to be created. Valid values are prefixed with ``AF_`
 *                      and defined in @ref socket.h.
 * @param[in] type      Specifies the type of socket to be created. Valued
 *                      values are prefixed with ``SOCK_`` and defined in
 *                      @ref socket.h.
 * @param[in] protocol  Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
 *                      socket. Specifying a protocol of 0 causes socket() to
 *                      use an unspecified default protocol appropriate for
 *                      the requested socket type.
 *
 * @return  Upon successful completion, socket() shall return a non-negative
 *          integer, the socket file descriptor. Otherwise, a value of -1 shall
 *          be returned and errno set to indicate the error.
