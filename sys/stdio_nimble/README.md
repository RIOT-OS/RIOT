# STDIO NimBLE

This module uses NimBLE for stdio. The bluetooth characteristic for
stdin is writable and the characteristic for stdout uses the indicate
mechanism to publish the system's output to a connected device. Data will be
sent out asynchronously via callout functions.

To use this module, add
```
USEMODULE += stdio_nimble
```
to your makefile.

You can change the default buffer sizes by adding
```
CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_STDIO_NIMBLE_STDIN_BUFSIZE=1024
CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_STDIO_NIMBLE_STDOUT_BUFSIZE=2048
```
to your makefile. \
**NOTE:** These values must be a power of two!

By default, stdin and stdout buffers are cleared on a connect event. To keep the
content add the following to your makefile:
```
CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_STDIO_NIMBLE_CLEAR_BUFFER_ON_CONNECT=0
```

For automatic bluetooth advertising a module is provided: *nimble_autoadv*.
It will take care of enabling advertising on disconnect events and
disabling advertising on connect events. It can be enabled by adding
```
USEMODULE += nimble_autoadv
```
to your makefile.

The advertised device name can then optionally be configured with
```
CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_NIMBLE_AUTOADV_DEVICE_NAME='"Riot OS device"'
```
Otherwise the device will appear as "*RIOT OS device*".

## Instructions to connect to the bluetooth shell via ble-serial

- Configure and compile shell app for nrf52840dongle target in `tests/shell`.\

Add following to Makefile:
```
BOARD = nrf52840dongle
USEMODULE += nimble_autoadv
USEMODULE += stdio_nimble
```

**NOTE:** You can also have a look at `tests/shell_ble`.

- Flash

`$ make -C tests/shell -j clean all flash`

- Install the ble-serial tool

`$ pip install ble-serial`

- Scan for your device (device name `Riot OS device`) and note its BLE address.\
  When you get `ble-scan: command not found` you can also run
  `python -m ble_serial.scan` instead.
```
