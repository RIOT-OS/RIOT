/**
 * @brief   Permute the ABCD "registers" using the 64-byte <block> as a driver
 *
 * The MD5 algorithm operates on a set of four longwords stored (conceptually)
 * in four "registers".  It is easy to imagine a simple MD4/5 chip that would
 * operate this way.  In any case, the mangling of the contents of those
 * registers is driven by the input message.  The message is chopped and finally
 * padded into 64-byte chunks and each chunk is used to manipulate the contents
 * of the registers.
 *
 * The MD5 Algorithm calls for padding the input to ensure that it is a multiple
 * of 64 bytes in length. The last 16 bytes of the padding space are used to
 * store the message length (the length of the original message, before padding,
 * expressed in terms of bits). If there is not enough room for 16 bytes worth
 * of bitcount (eg., if the original message was 122 bytes long) then the block
 * is padded to the end with zeros and passed to this function. Then *another*
 * block is filled with zeros except for the last 16 bytes which contain the
 * length.
 *
 * Oh... and the algorithm requires that there be at least one padding byte. The
 * first padding byte has a value of 0x80, and any others are 0x00.
 *
 * @param[in|out] abcd      Pointer to an array of four unsigned longwords
