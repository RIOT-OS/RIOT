 *
 *
 * @brief   Implementation if system calls for newlib using RIOT functionality.
 *
 * The submodules in here use RIOT modules to provide a portable set of system
 * calls for newlib.
 *
 * System calls are split into submodules according to which of RIOT's module
 * they require. Special logic in Makefile.dep causes the correct system calls
 * to be enabled automatically whenever the required modules are enabled.
 *
 * For example, using xtimer automatically causes newlib_syscalls_riot_clock to
 * be used.
 *
 * If the functionality of these system calls is not needed, but only their
 * existence, to avoid a linking error the newlib_stubs module can be used.
 * This can be useful if one has a package that uses functionality in the
 * standard library that requires the system calls, but it is not a problem if
 * those calls always fail.
 *
 * Submodules:
 *
 * - sys_newlib_syscalls_riot_clock
