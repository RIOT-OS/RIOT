/**
 * @ingroup  sys
 * @defgroup sys_newlib_stubs Newlib system call stubs
 *
 *
 * These module provide stubs (functions that always return an error) for the
 * system calls required by newlib:
 *
 *  - File handling: _open_r, _close_r, _lseek_r, _read_r, _write_r, _stat_r,
 *    _fstat_r, _link_r, _unlink_r, _fcntl_r
 *  - Process control: _execve_r, _wait_r, _fork_r, _getpid_r
 *  - Memory management: _sbrk_r
 *  - Timekeeping: _gettimeofday_r, _times_r
 *
 * Stubs for these functions can be found in the newlib source, under newlib/libc/reent/.
 *
 * Stubs may be needed if an external module uses a standard library function
 * that depends on a syscall, but it is not desired to pull in the code needed
 * to support it (for example, there is no point in having VFS if there is no
 * storage support.) In many of these cases it is perfectly acceptable if those
 * functions do nothing but fail.
