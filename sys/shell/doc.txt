Shell Commands
==============

Certain modules such as `ps`, `saul_reg`, or `gnrc_icmpv6_echo` can expose
(some of) their functionality not only as C-API, but also as shell command.
Using the module `shell_commands` will enable the shell integration of the used
modules, if it exists.

A few rarely needed shell commands that needs to be used in addition to the
`shell_commands` and the module providing the C-API. Examples include
`shell_cmd_nice`, `shell_cmd_gnrc_udp`, or `shell_random_cmd`.
Consult the documentation of the modules to find out whether they have a
shell integration and how to enable it.
