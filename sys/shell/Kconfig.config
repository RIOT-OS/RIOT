        Some systems (e.g Ubuntu 20.04) close stdin on CTRL-D / EOF
        That means we can't just re-start the shell.
        Instead terminate RIOT, which is also the behavior a user would expect
        from a CLI application.

config SHELL_NO_ECHO
    bool "Disable echo"

config SHELL_NO_PROMPT
    bool "Disable prompt"
