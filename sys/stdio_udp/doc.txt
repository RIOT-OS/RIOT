 * @brief       STDIO over UDP implementation
 *
 * This file implements STDIO via a UDP that can be used with e.g. netcat:
 *
 *      nc -u fe80::7837:fcff:fe7d:1aaf%tapbr0 2323
 *
 * It can be enabled with
 *
 *      USEMODULE += stdio_udp
 *
 * and will listen on `CONFIG_STDIO_UDP_PORT` for incoming connections.
 *
 * You will also have to set `I_UNDERSTAND_THAT_STDIO_UDP_IS_INSECURE = 1` to
 * acknowledge that you will only use this for debugging in an isolated network.
 *
 * @warning     This is entirely unsecured, only use this for debugging in
 *              an isolated network!
