 * @brief       Arduino in RIOT
 *
 * @section sec_about About
 *
 * This module enables users to run unmodified Arduino sketches in RIOT. For
 * this we aim at supporting the full Arduino API.
 *
 * The support of the Arduino API in RIOT is useful for multiple reasons:
 * - starting point for beginners
 * - run your existing sketches on any non-Arduino hardware supported by RIOT
 * - makes it easy to move from Arduino to RIOT
 * - use Arduino device drivers in RIOT
 * - is fun to implement :-)
 *
 * Refer to @ref sys_arduino_api for the actual API documentation
 *
 *
 * @section sec_usage General usage
 *
 * To run your Arduino sketch in RIOT, just follow these steps:
 *
 * -# create an empty application
 * -# add the `arduino` module to your application, your `Makefile` should now
 *    look something like this:
 * @code
 * APPLICATION = YOUR_APP_NAME
 * BOARD ?= YOUR_TARGET_PLATFORM
 * RIOTBASE ?= PATH_TO_RIOT_ROOT
 *
 * USEMODULE += arduino
 *
 * include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include
 * @endcode
 *
 * -# copy your Arduino sktech(es) into your application folder. Currently they
 *    must have the file ending `*.sketch` to be processed.
 * -# build, flash, and run your application the usual RIOT-way: simply call
 *    `make all`, `make flash`, `make term`, etc.
 *
 * That's all. As bonus you can of course use any existing RIOT code inside your
 * Arduino sketches - you simply have to add the includes to your sketch and
 * the corresponding modules to your `Makefile`.
 *
 * @note  So far, all Arduino sketches MUST have the file ending `*.sketch` to
 *        be recognized by RIOT's build system
 *
 *
 * @section sec_concept Concept
 *
 * For enabling RIOT to run Arduino sketches, we extended the build system to
 * handle `*.sketch` files and we implemented the Arduino API using RIOT's
 * native functions.
 *
 * @subsection sec_concept_build Extension of the build system
 *
 * Building Arduino sketches in RIOT is done in a three step process.
 *
 * First, the make system defines a generated `arduino_sketches` module placed
 * into `$(BINDIR)`
 * [Arduino sketches makefile](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/sys/arduino/sketches.inc.mk),
 * which is included from the
 * [Makefile.include](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/sys/arduino/Makefile.include)
 * of the RIOT Arduino module.
 * The generated module is added to used modules and build directories.
 *
 * Second, as prerequisites for the `link` target, the make system will create
 * the module into `$(BINDIR)/arduino_sketches` with an `arduino_sketches.cpp`
 * source file.
 * Into this file, it copies some Arduino glue code (
 * [pre.snip](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/arduino/pre.snip)
 *  and
 * [post.snip](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/arduino/post.snip))
 * together with the contents of all `*.sketch` files contained in the
 * application folder.
 *
 * Third, the RIOT make system is called as usual, building the generated
 * library with the Arduino code and including it in the final firmware.
 *
 * @subsection sec_conecpt_api Implementation of the Arduino API
 *
 * For supporting the Arduino API, we have created our own function and class
 * definitions, using the exact same signatures as in the original Arduino
 * header files. These headers are then implemented using standard RIOT APIs,
 * e.g. the peripheral drivers, `xtimer`, etc.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_boardsupport Add Arduino support to a board
 *
 * @note    As prerequisite, the board must have support for C++. Support for
 *          the standard C++ lib (feature `libstdcpp`) is not required.
 *
 * As a minimum requirement, the features `arduino_pins` is a hard dependency.
 * See [Digital Pins](https://guide.riot-os.org/misc/io_mapping_and_shields/#digital-pins
 * what a board needs to provide this.
 *
 * Additional mappings for analog pins
 * (see [Analog Pins](https://guide.riot-os.org/misc/io_mapping_and_shields/#analog-pins))
 * and PWM pins
 * (see [PWM Pins](https://guide.riot-os.org/misc/io_mapping_and_shields/#pwm-pins))
 * is required to be able to use
 * `analogRead()` and `analogWrite()`.
 *
 * See also [IO-Mapping and Shields](https://guide.riot-os.org/board_specific/io_mapping_and_shields/)
 * on how a board can provide more I/O mappings and even
 * declare electrical and mechanical compatibility with common Arduino form
 * factors.
 *
 * @section sec_todo Open issues
 *
 * @todo Make it possible to bootstrap Arduino code manually from any RIOT
 *       application. Include a pseudomule as e.g. arduino_base, which does not
 *       implement a main function calling `setup()` and `loop()`, so these
 *       functions have to be called manually from a RIOT application.
 * @todo Implement analog outputs (PWM mapping)
 * @todo Implement analog inputs (ADC mapping)
 * @todo Add means to include various Arduino Libraries (maybe as pkg?)
 * @todo Implement anything else that is missing...
 * @todo Adapt Arduino build script, so sketches do not have to have the file
 *       ending `*.sketch` anymore
