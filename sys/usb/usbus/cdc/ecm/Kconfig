        This defines a common up and down link throughput in bits/second. The
        USB peripheral will report this to the host. This doesn't affect the
        actual throughput, only what the peripheral reports to the host.

        This is the link download speed, defined in bits/second, that the USB
        peripheral will report to the host.
