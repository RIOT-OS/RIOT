 *
 * Storage facilities implement the
 * @ref registry_store_itf_t "Storage interface" to allow the
 * @ref sys_registry "RIOT Registry" to load, search and store configuration
 * parameters during runtime.
 * From the point of view of the Registry all parameters are key/value strings
 * and it is responsibility of the storage facilities to transform that to the
 * proper format for storage.
 *
 * A minimal setup for the Registry requires at least one source storage
 * facility from which configurations are loaded and exactly one storage
 * facility destination to which configurations are stored.
