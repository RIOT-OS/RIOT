/**
 * \defgroup elfloaderarch Architecture specific functionality for the ELF loader.
 *
 * The architecture specific functionality for the Contiki ELF loader
 * has to be implemented for each processor type RIOT runs on.
 *
 * Since the ELF format is slightly different for different processor
 * types, the Contiki ELF loader is divided into two parts: the
 * generic ELF loader module (\ref elfloader) and the architecture
 * specific part (this module). The architecture specific part deals
 * data relocation, and writing the relocated ELF code into program
 * memory.
 *
 * To port the Contiki ELF loader to a new processor type, this module
 * has to be implemented for the new processor type.

/**
 * \brief      Perform a relocation.
 * \param objPtr
 *             The file descriptor for the ELF file.
 * \param sectionoffset The file offset at which the relocation can be found.
 * \param sectionaddr The section start address (absolute runtime).
 * \param rela A pointer to an ELF32 rela structure (struct elf32_rela).
 * \param addr The relocated address.
 *
 *             This function is called from the Contiki ELF loader to
 *             perform a relocation on a piece of code or data. The
 *             relocated address is calculated by the Contiki ELF
 *             loader, based on information in the ELF file, and it is
 *             the responsibility of this function to patch the
 *             executable code. The Contiki ELF loader passes a
 *             pointer to an ELF32 rela structure (struct elf32_rela)
 *             that contains information about how to patch the
 *             code. This information is different from processor to
 *             processor.
