 *
 * @brief       Flash Translation Layer (FTL) intended to provide a uniform interface
 *              to flash-based data storage devices.
 *

Current flash storage chips commonly have blocksizes of 2k or more. The RIOT FTL divides
each page on the flash device into one or more so-called subpages to reduce the size of
the required read/write buffers. Each subpage is optionally attached with an error
correction code.

On initialization, the device is divided into two partitions, the index partition intended
for metadata and the data partition.

Initialization
==============

In order to make use of the FTL, it needs to be initialized with the parameters
particular to the flash device you wish to use:

- The device page size
- The amount of pages in each erase block
- The total amount of pages on the devices (or as many as you wish to address)

In addition, a subpage size fitting the storage device needs to be chosen, knowing that
the FTL will allocate a read/write buffer of the same size. There are some constraints
to keep in mind when choosing the subpage size:

- Size of the ECC scales increases with the subpage size (see #ftl_ecc_size).
- The target flash storage must support at least (page size)/(subpage size) sequential
  writes to the same page (without having to erase the resident block).
- Since each subpage is preceded by a dedicated header, the metadata to data ratio will
  gets worse with decreasing subpage size.

Lastly, the FTL needs to be given three callbacks for reading/writing raw data and for
erasing a single block. For the required signature please see the write/read/erase members
of #ftl_device_s.

Example
-------

Let's assume a device with a page size of 2048 bytes and a blocksize of 1024 pages,
supporting 4 sequential writes to the same page. The total capacity of the device is 8GiB
resulting in 4,194,304 pages and 4096 blocks.

For this device we would pick a subpage size of 2048 / 4 = 512 bytes. The initialization
would then look as follows:

    ftl_device_s device;

    device.write = ...
    device.read = ...
    device.erase = ...

    device.page_size = 2048;
    device.subpage_size = 512;
    device.pages_per_block = 1024;
    device.total_pages = 4194304;

    int ret = ftl_init(&device);
    if(ret != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error initializing the device\n");
    }



Usage
=====

After the device is initialized, we can proceed with reading/writing some data. As an
example we will first format the index partition of the device and proceed to write
some data:

    int ret = ftl_format(&device.index_partition);
    if(ret != 0) { Error }

    char buffer[512]; // Allocate a buffer which can hold a page
    memset(subpage, 0xAB, 512); // Generate some data to write

    int target_subpage = 1234;
    ret = ftl_write(&device.index_partition, buffer, target_subpage);
    if(ret != 0) { Error }

It is very important to note that the above will __NOT__ write 512 bytes to the subpage,
since each of them is equipped with at least a subpage header (3 bytes) and an optional
ECC. As a result, the above will only write 509 bytes of data. This can be verified
as follows:

    subpageheader_s header;
    ret = ftl_read(&device.index_partition, buffer, &header, target_subpage);
    if(ret != 0) { Error }

    assert(header.data_length == 509);

Writing data with an ECC works similarly:

    ret = ftl_write_ecc(&device.index_partition, buffer, target_subpage);
    if(ret != 0) { Error }

    ret = ftl_read(&device.index_partition, buffer, &header, target_subpage);
    if(ret != 0) { Error }

    assert(header.data_length == 503);

To know in advance how much data can be written per page, one can use the
#ftl_data_per_subpage function:

    int data_length = ftl_data_per_subpage(&device, false);
    int data_length_with_ecc = ftl_data_per_subpage(&device, true);

    assert(data_length == 509);
    assert(data_length_with_ecc == 503);
