 * @brief        SRAM based physically unclonable function (PUF)
 * @experimental This API is experimental and in an early state - expect
 *               changes!
 * @warning      The SRAM based seed mechanism it not cryptographically secure in its current
                 state.
 *
 * # About
 *
 * Transistor variations of SRAM memory cells lead to different states
 * after device power-on. The startup state of multiple memory
 * blocks form a device-unique pattern plus additional noise ("weak PUF").
 * The noise is used to generate random numbers for PRNG seeding.
 *
 * # Preliminaries
 *
 * High entropy numbers can only be generated when the device starts from power-off (including
 * low-power modes that turn of the RAM partly)
 * and before the memory has been used. That's why the SRAM PUF procedure is implemented
 * even before kernel initialization.
 * Memory properties are hardware specific and can depend on environmental conditions.
 * Thus, they should be evaluated for each individual deployment. A basic
 * testing tool is provided in /RIOT/tests/puf_sram.
 *
 * # Soft-reset detection
 *
 * In order to detect a software reboot without preceding power-off phase, a soft-reset
 * detection mechanism writes a marker memory @p PUF_SRAM_MARKER into SRAM. If the marker
 * is still present after a restart, a soft-reset is expected and the PUF procedure
 * is skipped.
 *
 * # Random Seed Generation
 *
 * Uninitialized memory pattern are compressed by the lightweight DEK hash function
 * to generate a high entropy 32-bit integer which can be used to seed a PRNG. This hash
 * function is not cryptographically secure and as such, adversaries might be able to
 * track parts of the initial SRAM response by analyzing PRNG sequences.
