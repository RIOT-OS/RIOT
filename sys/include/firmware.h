 * # riotboot minimal firmware update infrastructure
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * riotboot is the name of a minimal bootloader application and infrastructure.
 * It consists of
 *
 * - the application "riotboot" in "dist/riotboot" which serves as
 *   minimal bootloader
 *
 * - the modules "firmware" and "firmware_update" that are used
 *   in an image to handle verification and flash-writing
 *
 * - the module "ota_coap" which serves as transport for the updates
 *
 * - a tool in dist/tools/firmware which handles key generation
 *   and firmware image signing.
 *
 * - a couple of make targets to glue everything together
 *
 * ## Concept
 *
 * riotboot expects the flash to be split in three parts: one for the
 * bootloader itself, and two slots for images.
 * Of the latter, one slot holds the running (or latest) image, while the other is
 * used to write a newer image.
 *
 * The bootloader will, on reset, verify the checksum of the image slots, then
 * choose the one with the highest version number that has a valid checksum.  If
 * all slots have the same version number, the first one will be booted.  If none
 * of the slots has a valid checksum, no image will be booted and the bootloader
 * will enter "while(1);".
 *
 * Any image that the bootloader can load is supposed to be signed by the firmware
 * tool, which will take an image, sign it using tweetnacl prefixes the image with
 * corresponding metadata.
 *
 * The metadata contains
 *
 * - "RIOT" as magic number
 * - an application version
 * - Start address
 * - a checksum
 *
 * The bootloader only cares about checksum and application version. It expects a
 * running image to verify the metadata.
 *
 * All image transportation and verification is supposed to be done by a running
 * image.
 *
 * The user must update using a binary that has been linked & signed for the
 * desired target slot.
 * The slot that contains the running image cannot be overwritten.
 *
 * The module "firmware_update" provides a simple API that can be fed image data
 * in arbitrary block sizes.  The API is similar to stream hashing. There's
 * "firmware_update_init()", "firmware_update_put_bytes()" and
 * "firmware_update_finish()".  The module transparently handles image
 * verification and flash writing.
 *
 * A tool in dist/tools/firmware can create the necessary keys using tweetnacl,
 * and also sign/verify firmware images.
 *
 * A module in sys/firmware contains common code for firmware metadata handling.
 *
 * ## Threat vector
 *
 * If properly used, riotboot allows secure updates of running firmware.
 * Only update requests that have a valid signature will cause a write to flash.
 * Only updates with a higher version number will be considered, protecting from
 * replay or downgrade attacks, given a node is running the latest version.
 * Updates cannot put the node in undefined state if an upgrade is aborted at any
 * time or otherwise invalid.
 * Only correctly written and verified updates are considered by the bootloader.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * riotboot needs a public key to be compiled in the image for verification purposes.
 * Create a keypair using dist/tools/firmware.
 *
 * riotboot needs some board specific support, mainly slot size configuration, in
 * order to work for a specific board.
 *
 * If that support is in place, it is easiest to use the riotboot specific make
 * targets in order to get the support on the device.
 *
 * See README.md in examples/ota for examples.
