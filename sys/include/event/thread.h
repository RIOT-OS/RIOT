/**
 * @ingroup     sys_event
 * @brief       Provides utility functions for event handler threads
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * By using the module `event_thread`, the event queues
 * @ref EVENT_PRIO_HIGHEST, @ref EVENT_PRIO_MEDIUM, and
 * @ref EVENT_PRIO_LOWEST are provided and declared in the header
 * `event/thread.h`. With default settings, the `auto_init` module will
 * automatically start one or more threads to handle these
 * queues.
 *
 * By default, a single thread with priority `EVENT_THREAD_MEDIUM_PRIO`
 * will handle all three event queues according to their priority.
 * An already started event handler will not be preempted in this case by an
 * incoming higher priority event. Still, lower priority event queues will only
 * be worked on once the higher priority queues are empty. Hence, the worst case
 * latency is increased by the worst case duration of any possible lower
 * priority event in this configuration.
 *
 * By using module `event_thread_highest`, the highest priority queue gets its
 * own thread. With this, events of the highest priority can preempt already
 * running event handlers of medium and lowest priority.
 *
 * By using module `event_thread_medium`, the lowest priority events are handled
 * in their own thread. With this, events of at least medium priority can
 * preempt already running events of the lowest priority.
 *
 * By using both module `event_thread_highest` and `event_thread_medium`, each
 * event queue gets its own thread. So higher priority events will always
 * preempt events of lower priority in this case.
 *
 * Finally, the module `event_thread_lowest` is provided for backward
 * compatibility and has no effect.
