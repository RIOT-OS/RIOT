/**
 * @ingroup     sys
 * @brief       Trace program flows
 *
 * This module allows recording program flow traces. It is meant for debugging
 * in multi-threaded applications or when ISR's are involved.
 *
 * The `trace()` function takes an arbitrary (user chosen) uint32 value.
 * Calling the function is safe from anywhere (user code, ISR, ...) and safely
 * logs the function call time and user value in a trace buffer.
 *
 * At any point, `trace_dump()` can be used to print the trace buffer.
 *
 * The buffer has a default size of 512 entries, which can be overridden by
 * defining CONFIG_TRACE_BUFSIZE. It can be cleared using `trace_reset()`.
 * The trace buffer works like a ring-buffer. If it is full, it will start
 * overwriting from the beginning.
 *
 * Tracing is made thread safe by disabling interrupts for critical sections.
 *
 * It does incur some overhead (at least a function call, getting the current
 * time, a pair of enable/disable interrupts and a couple of memory accesses).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * #include "trace.h"
 * ...
 * trace(<user chosen uint32 value);
 *
 * trace_dump();
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * supposed to provide a meaningful value.
