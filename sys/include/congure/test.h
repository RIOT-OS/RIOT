 * This module requires an application defined `congure_impl.h` which defines
 * the congure_snd_t extension of the CongURE implementation as
 * @ref congure_test_snd_t and provides a function declaration
 * @ref congure_test_snd_setup() setup said type. E.g.

 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * typedef congure_reno_snd_t congure_test_snd_t;
 *
 * void congure_test_snd_setup(congure_test_snd_t *c, int id);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * All constants and initial values can then be set within the application
 * specific definition of @ref congure_test_snd_setup().
