/**
 * @defgroup    sys_event Event Queue
 * @ingroup     sys
 * @brief       Provides an Event loop
 *
 * This module offers an event queue framework like libevent or libuev.
 *
 * An event queue is basically a FIFO queue of events, with some functions to
 * efficiently and safely handle adding and getting events to / from such a
 * queue.
 *
 * An event queue is bound to a thread, but any thread or ISR can put events
 * into a queue. In most cases, the owning thread of a queue is set during the
 * queue's initialization. But it is also possible to initialize a queue in a
 * detached state from a different context and to set the owning thread
 * at a later point of time using the event_queue_claim() function.
 *
 * An event is a structure containing a pointer to an event handler. It can be
 * extended to provide context or arguments to the handler.  It can also be
 * embedded into existing structures (see examples).
 *
 * Compared to msg or mbox, this some fundamental differences:
 *
 * 1. events are "sender allocated". Unlike msg_send(), event_post() never
 *    blocks or fails.
 * 2. events contain everything necessary to handle them, thus a thread
 *    processing the events of an event queue doesn't need to be changed in
 *    order to support new event types.
 * 3. events can be safely used (and actually perform best) when used within
 *    one thread, e.g., in order to create a state-machine like process flow.
 *    This is not (easily) possible using msg queues, as they might fill up.
 * 4. an event can only be queued in one event queue at the same time.
 *    Notifying many queues using only one event object is not possible with
 *    this implementation.
 *
 * At the core, event_wait() uses thread flags to implement waiting for events
 * to be queued. Thus event queues can be used safely and efficiently in combination
 * with thread flags and msg queues.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * // simple event handler
 * static void handler(event_t *event)
 * {
 *    printf("triggered 0x%08x\n", (unsigned)event);
 * }
 *
 * static event_t event = { .handler = handler };
 * static event_queue_t queue;
 *
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *     event_queue_init(&queue);
 *     event_loop(&queue);
 * }
 *
 * [...] event_post(&queue, &event);
 *
 * // example for event extended event struct
 * typedef struct {
 *     event_t super;
 *     const char *text;
 * } custom_event_t;
 *
 * static void custom_handler(event_t *event)
 * {
 *     custom_event_t *custom_event = (custom_event_t *)event;
 *     printf("triggered custom event with text: \"%s\"\n", custom_event->text);
 * }
 *
 * static custom_event_t custom_event = { .super.handler = custom_handler, .text = "CUSTOM EVENT" };
 *
 * [...] event_post(&queue, &custom_event)
