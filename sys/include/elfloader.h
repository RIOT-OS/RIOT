/**
 * This file is an adoptation of the The Contiki ELF loader.
 *
 * The ELF loader links, relocates, and loads ELF (Executable Linkable
 * Format) object files into a running RIOT system.
 *
 * ELF is a standard format for relocatable object code and executable
 * files. ELF is the standard program format for Linux, Solaris, and
 * other operating systems.
 *
 * An ELF file contains is either a standalone executable program or a
 * program module. The file contains both the program code, the
 * program data, as well as information about how to link, relocate,
 * and load the program into a running system.
 *
 * An ELF file is composed of a set of sections. The sections contain
 * program code, data, or relocation information, but can also contain
 * debugging information.
 *
 * To link and relocate an ELF file, the ELF loader first parses the
 * ELF file structure to find the appropriate ELF sections. It then
 * rewrites the ELF file, such that the blank spots are filled with
 * the correct addresses and thus making it ready for execution.
