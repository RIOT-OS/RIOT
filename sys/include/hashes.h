/**
 * @brief djb2_hash
 *
 * HISTORY
 * This algorithm (k=33) was first reported by Dan Bernstein many years
 * ago in comp.lang.c. Another version of this algorithm (now favored by
 * bernstein) uses XOR:
 *
 *      hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 33 ^ str[i];
 *
 * The magic of number 33 (why it works better than many other constants,
 * prime or not) has never been adequately explained.
 *
 * @param buf input buffer to hash
 * @param len length of buffer
 * @return 32 bit sized hash

/**
 * @brief sdbm_hash
 *
 * HISTORY
 * This algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation
 * of ndbm) database library. It was found to do well in scrambling bits,
 * causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also
 * happens to be a good general hashing function with good distribution.
 *
 * The actual function is
 *
 *      hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i];
 *
 * What is included below is the faster version used in gawk. [there is
 * even a faster, duff-device version] the magic constant 65599 was picked
 * out of thin air while experimenting with different constants, and turns
 * out to be a prime. this is one of the algorithms used in berkeley db
 * (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.

/**
 * @brief lose lose
 *
 * HISTORY
 * This hash function appeared in K&R (1st ed) but at least the reader
 * was warned:
 *
 *      "This is not the best possible algorithm, but it has the merit
 *      of extreme simplicity."
 *
 * This is an understatement. It is a terrible hashing algorithm, and it
 * could have been much better without sacrificing its "extreme simplicity."
 * [see the second edition!]
 *
 * Many C programmers use this function without actually testing it, or
 * checking something like Knuth's Sorting and Searching, so it stuck.
 * It is now found mixed with otherwise respectable code, eg. cnews. sigh.
 * [see also: tpop]
