 * @defgroup    sys_stdio_uart STDIO over UART
 * @ingroup     sys
 *
 * @brief       Standard input/output backend using UART
 *
 * @warning Standard input is disabled by default on UART. To enable it, load
 *          the `stdin` module in your application:
 * ```
 * USEMODULE += stdin
 * ```
 *
 * @attention   Using STDIO over UART from interrupt context should be avoided,
 *              except for debugging purposes
 *
 * For testing purposes and using STDIO within an ISR should mostly work good
 * enough and for some platforms even reliable. Production code however should
 * fully avoid any access to STDIO from interrupt context. Instead, e.g. an
 * event could be posted to an @ref sys_event and the actual STDIO operation
 * being deferred to thread context.
 *
 * Some reasons why STDIO over UART from ISR should be avoided:
 * 1. UART is *slow* and the system easily remains in interrupt context for
 *    unacceptable long time.
 *     - E.g. sending 100 chars at 9600 baud will block the system for
 *       100 milliseconds.
 *     - Missed deadlines, lost interrupts, or watch dog timer resets can easily
 *       be caused by this.
 * 2. Even if DMA is used for UART, using STDIO within ISR can cause significant
 *    delays: If the buffer is full, an UART implementation will be forced to
 *    resort to synchronously send the data, rather than using DMA. This might
 *    cause even more headache, as the available memory in the DMA buffer when
 *    an ISR is triggered has to be assumed as randomly distributed. Thus,
 *    hard to reproduce and indeterministic bugs can be the result.
 * 3. If an ISR is triggered from a power saving mode, some peripherals or
 *    clock domains might still be offline during that ISR; including the UART
 *    peripheral. This is a valid implementation choice to allow time critical
 *    low power scenarios being covered by RIOT. Thus, be prepared to
 *    loose output when using STDIO from ISR.
