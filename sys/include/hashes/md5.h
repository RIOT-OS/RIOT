/**
 * @defgroup    sys_hashes_md5 MD5
 * @ingroup     sys_hashes_unkeyed
 * @brief       Implementation of the MD5 hashing function
 *
 *  None of this will make any sense unless you're studying RFC 1321 as you
 *  read the code.
 *
 *  There are three primary motivations for this particular implementation.
 *  1) Programmer's pride.  I wanted to be able to say I'd done it, and I
 *     wanted to learn from the experience.
 *  2) Portability.  I wanted an implementation that I knew to be portable
 *     to a reasonable number of platforms.  In particular, the algorithm is
 *     designed with little-endian platforms in mind, but I wanted an
 *     endian-agnostic implementation.
 *  3) Compactness.  While not an overriding goal, I thought it worth-while
 *     to see if I could reduce the overall size of the result.  This is in
 *     keeping with my hopes that this library will be suitable for use in
 *     some embedded environments.
 *  Beyond that, cleanliness and clarity are always worth pursuing.
 *
 *  As mentioned above, the code really only makes sense if you are familiar
 *  with the MD5 algorithm or are using RFC 1321 as a guide.  This code is
 *  quirky, however, so you'll want to be reading carefully.

 * information.
 *
 * Once the context is initialized, the blocks of message data are passed to the
 * <md5_update()> function. Once the final bit of data has been handed to
 * <md5_update()> the context can be closed out by calling <md5_final()>, which
 * also calculates the final MD5 result. Don't forget to free an allocated
 * context structure when you've finished using it.
