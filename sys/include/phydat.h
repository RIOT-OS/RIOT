 * @brief       Generic data container for physical data and utility functions
 *
 * The purpose of this module is to introduce a common view on physical data
 * throughout RIOT. This data is typically the output from sensor readings, data
 * aggregation, and also the input for actuators.
 *
 * The idea is to enable different sensor/actuator drivers and other RIOT
 * modules to exchange and have the same view on this kind of data. Labeling
 * data with a unit type it's scaling makes it possible to pipe data between
 * modules in an automated fashion without the need of specialized software
 * wrappers and/or data normalization modules.
 *
 * @todo        It might make sense to introduce additional data types for
 *              increased precision, i.e. something like phydat_float_t...

/**
 * @brief   Generic data structure for expressing physical values
 *
 * Physical data is expressed in a 3-dimensional touple of values. In addition
 * to the data fields, this struct contains further the (physical) unit and the
 * scale factor of the data. The unit is expressed as constant. The scale factor
 * is expressed as power of 10 (10^factor).
 *
 * The combination of signed 16-bit numbers with and the scale factor gives us a
 * very high dynamic range (from -32*10^-131 to 32*10^130). In a wider sense we
 * are saving the values as fixed floating points...
 *
 * The scale factor is identical for all 3 values.
 *
 * In a traditional (scientific) computational system the obvious choice for the
 * used data type would be to use floats. We are however on heavily resource
 * constrained (even 8-bit) embedded systems, so we use int16_t here. As most
 * sensor are in some way ADC based, they normally do not use a higher accuracy
 * than 12-14bit, so using 16-bit integers to represent this data is good enough
 * in most cases.
