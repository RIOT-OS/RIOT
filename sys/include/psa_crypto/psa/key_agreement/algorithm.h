 *          with @ref psa_key_derivation_key_agreement().

 *              agreement and key derivation algorithm constructed with @ref PSA_ALG_ECDH.
 *
 *          When used as part of a multi-part key derivation operation, this implements a
 *          Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme using a single elliptic curve key-pair for each
 *          participant. This includes the Ephemeral unified model, the Static unified model, and

 *          @ref PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SECRET is used when providing the secret and peer keys
 *          to the operation.
 *
 *          The shared secret produced by key agreement is the x-coordinate of the shared secret
 *          point. It is always `ceiling(m / 8)` bytes long where `m` is the bit size associated
 *          with the curve, i.e. the bit size of the order of the curve’s coordinate field. When
 *          `m` is not a multiple of 8, the byte containing the most significant bit of the shared
 *          secret is padded with zero bits. The byte order is either little-endian or big-endian
 *          depending on the curve type.
 *
 *          -   For Montgomery curves (curve family @ref PSA_ECC_FAMILY_MONTGOMERY), the shared
 *              secret is the x-coordinate of `Z = d_A Q_B = d_B Q_A` in little-endian byte order.
 *              -   For Curve25519, this is the X25519 function defined in Curve25519: new

 *                  The bit size `m` is 255.
 *              -   For Curve448, this is the X448 function defined in Ed448-Goldilocks, a new
 *                  elliptic curve [Curve448](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/625.pdf).
 *                  The bit size `m` is 448.
 *          -   For Weierstrass curves (curve families @c PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX,
 *              @c PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX, @ref PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1 and
 *              @ref PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP) the shared secret is the x-coordinate of
 *              `Z = h d_A Q_B = h d_B Q_A` in big-endian byte order. This is the Elliptic Curve

 *              Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography
 *              [SP800-56A](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Ar3) §5.7.1.2.
 *              -   Over prime fields (curve families @c PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX,
 *                  @ref PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1 and @ref PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP),
 *                  the bit size is `m = ceiling(log_2(p))` for the field `F_p`.
 *              -   Over binary fields (curve families @c PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX), the bit size
 *                  is `m` for the field `F_{2^m}`.
 *
 * @note    The cofactor Diffie-Hellman primitive is equivalent to the standard elliptic curve
