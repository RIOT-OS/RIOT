 * @brief   The type of the state object for key derivation operations.
 *
 * @details Before calling any function on a key derivation operation object, the application must
 *          initialize it by any of the following means:
 *          - Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:
 *            @code
 *            @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_t operation;
 *            memset(&operation, 0, sizeof(operation));
 *            @endcode
 *          - Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or
 *            global without an explicit initializer, for example:
 *            @code
 *            static @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_t operation;
 *            @endcode
 *          - Initialize the object to the initializer @ref PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_OPERATION_INIT,
 *            for example:
 *            @code
 *            @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_t operation =
 *            @ref PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_OPERATION_INIT;
 *            @endcode
 *          - Assign the result of the function @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_init() to
 *            the object, for example:
 *            @code
 *            @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_t operation;
 *            operation = @ref psa_key_derivation_operation_init();
 *            @endcode
 *          This is an implementation-defined type. Applications that make assumptions about the
