 *
 *          The ARC4 cipher does not use an initialization vector (IV). When using a multi-part

 *              output.
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_decrypt() will use first 12 bytes of the input buffer as
 *              the nonce and set the counter value to zero.
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_generate_iv() on a multi-part cipher operation will

 *              the following IV sizes:
 *              -   12 bytes: the provided IV is used as the nonce, and the counter value is
 *                  set to zero.
 *               -  16 bytes: the first four bytes of the IV are used as the counter value (encoded
 *                  as little-endian), and the remaining 12 bytes is used as the nonce.
 *               -  8 bytes: the cipher operation uses the original

/**
 * @brief   A stream cipher built using the Counter (CTR) mode of a block cipher.
 *
 * @details CTR is a stream cipher which is built from a block cipher. The underlying block cipher
 *          is determined by the key type. For example, to use AES-128-CTR, use this algorithm with
 *          a key of type @ref PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES and a size of 128 bits (16 bytes).
 *
 *          The CTR block cipher mode is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-38A:
 *          Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods and Techniques [SP800-38A].
 *
 *          CTR mode requires a counter block which is the same size as the cipher block length.
 *          The counter block is updated for each block (or a partial final block) that is
 *          encrypted or decrypted.
 *
 *          A counter block value must only be used once across all messages encrypted using the
 *          same key value. This is typically achieved by splitting the counter block into a nonce,
 *          which is unique among all message encrypted with the key, and a counter which is
 *          incremented for each block of a message.
 *
 *          For example, when using AES-CTR encryption, which uses a 16-byte block, the application
 *          can provide a 12-byte nonce when setting the IV. This leaves 4 bytes for the counter,
 *          allowing up to 2^32 blocks (64GB) of message data to be encrypted in each message.
 *
 *          The first counter block is constructed from the initialization vector (IV). The initial
 *          counter block is is constructed in the following ways:
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_encrypt() will generate a random counter block value.
 *              This is the first block of output.
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_decrypt() will use first block of the input buffer as the
 *              initial counter block value.
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_generate_iv() on a multi-part cipher operation will
 *              generate and return a random counter block value.
 *          -   A call to @ref psa_cipher_set_iv() on a multi-part cipher operation requires an IV
 *              that is between 1 and n bytes in length, where n is the cipher block length. The
 *              counter block is initialized using the IV, and padded with zero bytes up to the
 *              block length.
 *
 *          During the counter block update operation, the counter block is treated as a single
 *          big-endian encoded integer and the update operation increments this integer by 1.
 *
 *          This scheme meets the recommendations in Appendix B of
 *          [SP800-38A](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-38A).
