 * @brief       Low-level ethernet driver interface
 * @{
 *
 * This interface is supposed to be a low-level interface for ethernet drivers.
 * In order to be universally usable, it leaves out many implementation details
 * to the implementation of an actual network stack using this interface.
 *
 * In order to write a driver for this interface, you have to
 *
 * 1. create a (possibly const) eth_driver_t structure for your device type,
 *    implement it's functions
 *
 * 2. create a dev_eth_t structure, used as device state and handle, for each device
 *
 * In order to use this interface, you have to
 *
 * 1. implement dev_eth_isr, dev_eth_rx_handler and dev_eth_linkstate_handler
 * 2. run a loop that get's notified by dev_eth_isr
 *
 * A devices send function should always be able to send a frame (and make sure of proper locking).
 *
 * Receive packet flow:
 *
 * 1. Ethernet driver receives packet, executes driver's internal ISR.
 * 2. driver's internal ISR should do minimal acknowledging and house keeping and then
 *    call dev_eth_isr
 * 3. dev_eth_isr should notify a user of this API (e.g., the network stack's L2 thread)
 * 4. That thread executes the driver's user-space isr (dev->driver->isr)
 * 5. user space ISR handles less timing critical stuff, eventually calling
 *    dev_eth_linkstate_handler and / or dev_eth_rx_handler
 *
 * Check out the dev_eth test application as example.
