 * @brief       Synchronous sock based messaging with nanocoap
 *
 * nanocoap sock uses the nanocoap CoAP library to provide a synchronous
 * interface to RIOT's sock networking API to read and write CoAP messages.
 * For a server, nanocoap sock accepts a list of resource paths with callbacks
 * for writing the response. For a client, nanocoap sock provides a function
 * to send a request and waits for the server response. nanocoap sock uses
 * nanocoap's Buffer API to write message options.
 *
 * ## Server Operation ##
 *
 * See the nanocoap_server example, which is built on the nanocoap_server()
 * function. A server must define an array of coap_resource_t resources for
 * which it responds. See the declarations of `coap_resources` and
 * `coap_resources_numof`. The array contents must be ordered by the resource
 * path, specifically the ASCII encoding of the path characters (digit and
 * capital precede lower case). Also see _Server path matching_ in the base
 * [nanocoap](group__net__nanocoap.html) documentation.
 *
 * nanocoap itself provides the COAP_WELL_KNOWN_CORE_DEFAULT_HANDLER entry for
 * `/.well-known/core`.
 *
 * ### Handler functions ###
 *
 * For each resource, you must implement a ::coap_handler_t handler function.
 * nanocoap provides functions to help implement the handler. If the handler
 * is called via nanocoap_server(), the response buffer provided to the handler
 * reuses the buffer for the request. So, your handler must read the request
 * thoroughly before writing the response.
 *
 * To read the request, use the functions in the _Header_ and _Options Read_
 * sections of the [nanocoap](group__net__nanocoap.html) documentation. If the
 * pkt _payload_len_ attribute is a positive value, start to read it at the
 * _payload_ pointer attribute.
 *
 * If a response does not require specific CoAP options, use
 * coap_reply_simple(). If there is a payload, it writes a Content-Format
 * option with the provided value.
 *
 * For a response with additional CoAP options, start by calling
 * coap_build_reply(). Then use the Buffer API to write the rest of the
 * response. See the instructions in the section _Write Options and Payload_
 * below.
 *
 * ## Client Operation ##
 *
 * Follow the instructions in the section _Write Options and Payload_ below.
 *
 * To send the message and await the response, see nanocoap_request() as well
 * as nanocoap_get(), which additionally copies the response payload to a user
 * supplied buffer. Finally, read the response as described above in the server
 * _Handler functions_ section for reading a request.
 *
 * ## Write Options and Payload ##
 *
 * For both server responses and client requests, CoAP uses an Option mechanism
 * to encode message metadata that is not required for each message. For
 * example, the resource URI path is required only for a request, and is encoded
 * as the Uri-Path option.
 *
 * nanocoap sock uses the nanocoap Buffer API for options. The caller
 * must provide the last option number written as well as the buffer position.
 * The caller is primarily responsible for tracking and managing the space
 * remaining in the buffer.
 *
 * Before starting, ensure the CoAP header has been initialized with
 * coap_build_hdr(). For a response, coap_build_reply() includes a call to
 * coap_build_hdr(). Use the returned length to track the next position in the
 * buffer to write and remaining length.
 *
 * Next, use the functions in the _Options Write Buffer API_ section of
 * [nanocoap](group__net__nanocoap.html) to write each option. These functions
 * require the position in the buffer to start writing, and return the number
 * of bytes written. Options *must* be written in order by option number (see
 * "CoAP option numbers" in [CoAP defines](group__net__coap.html)).
 *
 * @note You must ensure the buffer has enough space remaining to write each
 * option. The API does not verify the safety of writing an option.
 *
 * If there is a payload, append a payload marker (0xFF). Then write the
 * payload to within the maximum length remaining in the buffer.
 *
 * # Create a Block-wise Response (Block2)
 *
 * Block-wise is a CoAP extension (RFC 7959) to divide a large payload across
 * multiple physical packets. This section describes how to write a block-wise
 * payload for a response, and is known as Block2. (Block1 is for a block-wise
 * payload in a request.) See _riot_board_handler() in the nanocoap_server
 * example for an example handler implementation.
 *
 * Start with coap_block2_init() to read the client request and initialize a
 * coap_slicer_t struct with the size and location for this slice of the
 * overall payload. Then write the block2 option in the response with
 * coap_opt_put_block2(). The option includes an indicator ("more") that a
 * slice completes the overall payload transfer. You may not know the value for
 * _more_ at this point, but you must initialize the space in the packet for
 * the option before writing the payload. The option is rewritten later.
 *
 * Next, use the coap_blockwise_put_xxx() functions to write the payload
 * content. These functions use the coap_block_slicer_t to enable or disable
 * actually writing the content, depending on the current position within the
 * overall payload transfer.
 *
 * Finally, use the convenience function coap_block2_build_reply(), which
 * finalizes the packet and calls coap_block2_finish() internally to update
 * the block2 option.
