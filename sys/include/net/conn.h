 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * This module provides a minimal set of functions to establish a connection using
 * different types of connections. Together, they serve as a common API
 * that connects application- and network stack code.
 *
 * Currently the following connection types are defined:
 *
 * * @ref conn_ip_t (net/conn/ip.h): raw IP connections
 * * @ref conn_tcp_t (net/conn/tcp.h): TCP connections
 * * @ref conn_udp_t (net/conn/udp.h): UDP connections
 *
 * Each network stack must implement at least one connection type.
 *
 * Note that there might be no relation between the different connection types.
 * For simplicity and modularity this API doesn't put any restriction of the actual
 * implementation of the type. For example, one implementation might choose
 * to have all connection types have a common base class or use the raw IPv6
 * connection type to send e.g. UDP packets, while others will keep them
 * completely separate from each other.
 *
 * How To Use
 * ==========
 *
 * A RIOT application uses the functions provided by one or more of the connection types
 * headers (for example @ref conn_udp_t), regardless of the network stack it uses.
 * The network stack used under the bonnet is specified by including the appropriate
 * module (for example USEMODULE += gnrc_conn_udp)
 *
 * This allows for network stack agnostic code on the application layer.
 * The application code to establish a connection is always the same, allowing
 * the network stack underneath to be switched simply by changing the USEMODULE
 * definition in the application's Makefile.
