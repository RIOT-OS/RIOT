 * @brief       MAC address management
 *
 * About
 * =====
 *
 * An EUI provider provides an Extended Unique Identifier, that is
 * a hardware address for a network device.
 *
 * A board may have an EEPROM with a unique ID (e.g. @ref drivers_at24mac) that is used
 * to store an address, a unique address is stored in a config
 * area of the board's flash during production, etc.
 *
 * The EUI provider is connected to a network device that will then use
 * this address.
 *
 * How it works
 * ============
 *
 * If there is only one EUI provider on the board, the configuration
 * is done through three defines:
 *
 * - `EUIxx_PROVIDER_TYPE` to specify which device the EUI should be used for.
 *   That is to prevent it from matching to 'virtual' devices like ethos or SLIP.
 *   It is of course also possible to provide a fixed address for 'virtual' devices
 *   this way.

 * - `EUIxx_PROVIDER_INDEX` to specify which interface the EUI should be used for if
 *   there are multiple interfaces.
 *
 * - `EUIxx_PROVIDER_FUNC` the function that provides the EUI. It can use an optional
 *   `EUIxx_PROVIDER_ARG` argument that is passed unmodified.
 *
 * If more than one EUI provider is present on the board, an array of `euiXX_conf_t`
 * has to be provided to `EUI64_PROVIDER_PARAMS`:
 *
 * ```C
 * #define EUI64_PROVIDER_PARAMS {              \
 *              .provider = _board_get_eui,     \
 *              .arg      = BOARD_ADDR_SUBGHZ,  \
 *              .type     = NETDEV_AT86RF215,   \
 *              .index    = 0,   },             \
 *                               {              \
 *              .provider = _board_get_eui,     \
 *              .arg      = BOARD_ADDR_24GHZ,   \
 *              .type     = NETDEV_AT86RF215,   \
 *              .index    = 1,   }
 * ```
 *
 * This also assumes a `_board_get_eui()` function to provide the EUI.
 * For example, it could read an EUI from a config region on the flash
 * that is provided with the memory-mapped addresses `BOARD_ADDR_SUBGHZ` and
 * `BOARD_ADDR_24GHZ`.
 * The function would then do
 *
 * ```C
 * static inline int _board_get_eui(const void *src, eui64_t *addr)
 * {
 *     memcpy(addr, src, sizeof(*addr));
 *     return 0;
 * }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * Recommendations
 * ===============
 *
 * While it is possible to match EUIs with any netdev in a first come, first serve
 * fashion (`NETDEV_ANY`, `NETDEV_INDEX_ANY`) it is recommended to fix the EUI
 * providers to a device and interface to avoid them being used for 'virtual'
 * interfaces.
 *
 * Fixed addresses are only guaranteed if the network devices are also fixed.
 * E.g. if you usually have two netdevs and disable the first one at compile-time
 * the second interface will now use the first slot / index and therefore also
 * use the EUI provider that was previously used by interface in the first slot.
