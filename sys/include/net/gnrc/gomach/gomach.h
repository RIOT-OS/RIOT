 * @brief       A traffic-adaptive multi-channel MAC
 *
 *
 * GoMacH is, "a General, nearly Optimal MAC protocol for multi-Hop communications",
 * for IEEE 802.15.4 IoT/WSNs networks. It is designed to be a traffic adaptive MAC
 * protocol that provides high traffic adaptability, high energy efficiency and high
 * robustness.
 *
 * ## GoMacH's main features
 * - doesn't rely on global synchronization.
 * - supports for multi-hop and mesh network.
 * - adopts a duty-cycle scheme to conserve power.
 * - provides high traffic adaptation for handling burst or dynamic traffics.
 *   It achieves this by dynamically allocating transmission slots to intensive
 *   senders (that have pending packets), which enables one (or more) sender(s)
 *   to burst transmit all of its (their) buffered packets (for the same destination) to
 *   the receiver in one shot (or during a shot notice). The burst slotted-transmissions
 *   will be ordered by the receiver device in a TDMA period.
 * - adopts a multi-channel scheme for avoiding/reducing wireless interference jam.

 * This macro governs power consumption and GoMacH's reactiveness to traffic
 * loads. In GoMacH, nodes adopt duty-cycle scheme to conserve power. That is,
 * time is divided into repeated cycles (superframes), and in each cycle, a
 * node only wakes up for a short period of time for receiving potential
 * incoming packets for itself. This macro defines the wake-up interval, or,
 * in other words, defines the cycle duration used in GoMacH. If the wake-up
 * interval is short, nodes will wake up more frequently, which leads to quicker
 * reactiveness of the MAC protocol for handling packet reception and
 * transmission, but also results in higher power consumption due to more idle
 * listening. In GoMacH, by default, we regard the wake-up period (WP) as the
 * beginning of a cycle.
