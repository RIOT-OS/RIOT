    help
        In (NIST SP 800-90B 4.4.2) a window size of 512 samples is recommended for non-binary
        sources. Typically, RIOT use cases will not request as many samples, thus, it might be worth
        considering a smaller window size so the test is more likely to complete a cycle. It is
        noteworthy that a cutoff value calculated by @ref entropy_source_test_prop_cutoff that is
        greater than the window size may lead to undetected errors.

        Abort factor for von Neumann extractor. The algorithms runs as long as no bit
        changes appear in subsequent samples. This define adds a factor that
        aborts the procedure after (factor * requested length) samples.
