 * @brief      This module allows to monitor the dynamic memory usage of a certain piece of code.
 * @warning    This module automatically selects @ref sys_malloc_ts and naturally
 *             incurs a certain runtime overhead. It is not meant for production usage.

 * # Description
 *
 * This module allows to monitor the dynamic memory usage of a certain piece of code.
 * It works by hooking into (wrappers to) @ref malloc(), @ref calloc(), @ref realloc(),
 * and @ref free() calls to internally record the current and all-time maximum heap memory usage.
 *
 * Note that in general dynamic memory management is a bad idea on the constrained devices RIOT
 * is targeting. So maybe it is better to just adapt your code to use static memory management instead.
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * Enable the module with `USEMODULE += malloc_monitor`.
 *
 * Add `#include "malloc_monitor.h"` to the file in which you want to monitor dynamic memory usage.
 * Use @ref malloc_monitor_get_usage_current() to retrieve the size of the currently allocated
 * heap memory in bytes. @ref malloc_monitor_get_usage_high_watermark() returns the all-time maximum
 * since startup or the last call to  @ref malloc_monitor_reset_high_watermark().
 *
 * Note that `malloc_monitor` currently has no notion of threads and will at any point in time report
 * the global dynamic memory usage, not the one used by the currently running thread.
 * Thread-safety is achieved through usage of @ref sys_malloc_ts, though.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Imagine you want to investigate the dynamic memory consumption of a certain function `func()`.
 * The following snippet could get you started:
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <stddef.h>
 * #include <stdio.h>
 *
 * #include "malloc_monitor.h"
 *
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *     size_t before = malloc_monitor_get_usage_current();
 *     size_t before_max = malloc_monitor_get_usage_high_watermark();
 *     func();
 *     size_t after = malloc_monitor_get_usage_current();
 *     size_t after_max = malloc_monitor_get_usage_high_watermark();
 *
 *     if (after != before) {
 *         puts("func() " (after < before ? "decreased" : "increased") " global dynamic memory usage.");
 *     }
 *     printf("The maximal dynamic memory usage of func() was %d bytes.", after_max - before_max);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For further usage examples, refer to the corresponding tests in `tests/sys/malloc_monitor`.
 *
 * # Configuration
 *
 * The maximum number of pointers that can be monitored at once can be set with Kconfig
 * in System > Heap Memory Usage Monitor > Monitor Size or by setting the corresponding
 * CFlag in your application's Makefile as `CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_MODULE_SYS_MALLOC_MONITOR_SIZE=42`.
 * It defaults to 100.
 *
 * For more fine-grained debugging of invalid calls to @ref free(), duplicated calls to @ref free(),
 * or memory leaks, the module can be configured to print information on every call to @ref malloc(),
 * @ref calloc(), @ref realloc(), or @ref free() by setting System > Heap Memory Usage Monitor > Verbose
 * or adding `CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_MODULE_SYS_MALLOC_MONITOR_VERBOSE=1` to your Makefile.
 * `malloc_monitor` defaults to be non-verbose.
