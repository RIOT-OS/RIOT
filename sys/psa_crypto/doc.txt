/**
 * @defgroup    sys_psa_crypto    PSA Cryptographic API
 * @ingroup     sys
 * @brief       Implements the PSA Crypto API specification.
 * @see         https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/
 *
 * @warning This implementation is not complete and not yet thoroughly tested.
 *          Please do not use this module in production, as it may introduce security issues.
 *
 * @note    This implementation is not complete and will be successively expanded.
 *
 * About {#About}
 * =====
 * This module implements the PSA Cryptography API Version 1.1 as specified
 * [here](https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/).
 * It provides an OS level access to cryptographic operations and supports software and hardware
 * backends as well as the use of secure elements.
 * The API automatically builds a hardware backend for an operation, if there's one available,
 * otherwise it falls back to software. Specific backends can be configured, if needed.
 * For configuration options see [Configuration](#configuration).
 *
 * PSA Crypto has an integrated key management module, which stores keys internally
 * without exposing them to applications. To learn how to use keys with PSA,
 * read [Using Keys](#using-keys).
 *
 * A basic usage and configuration example can be found in `examples/psa_crypto`.
 * For more usage instructions, please read the documentation.
 *
 * If you want to add your own crypto backend, see [Porting Guide](#porting-guide).
 *
 * Basic Usage
 * ===
 * To use PSA Crypto, add `psa/crypto.h` to your includes. This will make all
 * operations and macros available.
 *
 * Call `psa_crypto_init()` before calling any other operation.
 *
 * ## Structure Initialization
 * Whenever you declare a PSA Crypto structure (e.g. operation contexts or key attributes),
 * it needs to be initialized with zeroes. A structure that is not initialized will be interpreted
 * by PSA as *active* and can not be used for a new operation.
 * The example function and macro shown below result in the same thing: A new, inactive structure.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 * // Choose one of these options
 * psa_hash_operation_t hash_op = psa_hash_operation_init();
 * psa_hash_operation_t hash_op = PSA_HASH_OPERATION_INIT;
 * @endcode
 *
 * An already active operation can be set to zero by reinitializing it. It then becomes *inactive*
 * again and can be used for a new operation.
 *
 * When errors occur during execution, PSA resets the operation contexts and makes them
 * *inactive*, to prevent unauthorized access to an operation's state.
 * Users can also call `psa_<operation>_abort()` anytime in between function calls to do the same.
 *
 * Using Keys {#using-keys}
 * ===
 * PSA can only operate on keys, that are registered with and stored within the internal
 * key storage module. This means you need to either generate keys with PSA or
 * import an existing key.
 * For this purpose there are a number of
 * [key management functions](https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/api/keys/management.html)
 * (external link).
 *
 * ## Key Attributes
 * When creating a key for PSA, the implementation needs to know what kind of key it is
 * dealing with, what it can be used for, where it's supposed to be stored, etc.
 * That information needs to be specified in a set of
 * [Key Attributes](https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/api/keys/attributes.html)
 * (external link).
 *
 * The example below defines attributes for an AES-128 key, which can be used for CBC encryption
 * and decryption and will be stored in local volatile memory.
 * @code
 * // Initializes empty attributes structure
 * psa_key_attributes_t attributes = psa_key_attributes_init();
 *
 * // Set all necessary attributes
 * psa_set_key_lifetime(&attributes, PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE);
 * psa_set_key_type(&attributes, PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES);
 * psa_set_key_bits(&attributes, 128);
 * psa_set_key_algorithm(&attributes, PSA_ALG_CBC_NO_PADDING);
 * psa_set_key_usage_flags(&attributes, (PSA_KEY_USAGE_ENCRYPT | PSA_KEY_USAGE_DECRYPT));
 * @endcode
 *
 * After setting the attributes, an exiting key can be imported:
 * @code
 * uint8_t aes_key[] = { ... };
 * psa_key_id_t key_id = 0;     // Will be set by PSA Crypto
 * psa_status_t status = psa_import_key(&attributes, aes_key, sizeof(aes_key), &key_id);
 * @endcode
 * The PSA Crypto implementation will assign an identifier to the key and return it
 * via the `key_id` parameter. This identifier can then be used for operations with this
 * specific key.
 * @code
 * uint8_t PLAINTEXT[] = { ... };
 * // Buffer sizes can be calculated with macros
 * size_t output_buf_size = PSA_CIPHER_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_SIZE(PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES, PSA_ALG_CBC_NO_PADDING,sizeof(PLAINTEXT));
 * uint8_t output_buffer[output_buf_size];
 *
 * status = psa_cipher_encrypt(key_id, PSA_ALG_CBC_NO_PADDING, PLAINTEXT, sizeof(PLAINTEXT),output_buffer, sizeof(output_buffer), &output_length));
 * @endcode
 *
 * All the supported key types, algorithms and usage flags can be found in the documentation.
 *
 * ### Key Lifetime {#key-lifetime}
 * #### Volatile vs. Persistent
 * The PSA API specifies two ways of storing keys: volatile and persistent. Volatile
 * keys will be stored only in RAM, which means they will be destroyed after application
 * termination or a device reset.
 * Persistent keys will also be written into flash memory for later access. To destroy
 * them they must be explicitly deleted with the `psa_destroy_key()` function.
 *
 * @note    Persistent key storage can be optionally enabled on `native` and on the `nRF52840dk`.
 *          For this, add `USEMODULE += psa_persistent_storage` to your application makefile
 *          or `CONFIG_MODULE_PSA_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=y` to your `app.config.test` file.
 *          Example: `tests/sys/psa_crypto_persistent_storage`
 *
 * @warning Be aware that the current implementation writes keys in plain text to flash memory.
 *          Anyone with hardware access can read them.
 *
 * #### Lifetime Encoding
 * When creating a key, the user needs to specify a lifetime value, which actually consists
 * of two values: persistence and location. The location defines the actual memory location
 * of the key (e.g. whether the key will be stored in RAM, in a hardware protected memory slot
 * or on an external device like a secure element).
 *
 * The persistence value defines whether the key will be stored in RAM (volatile)
 * in flash (persistent).
 * Some default values that exist are:
 * - @ref PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE (stored in local, volatile memory)
 * - @ref PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_PERSISTENT (stored in local, persistent memory)
 *
 * Other lifetime values can be constructed with the macro
 * `PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_FROM_PERSISTENCE_AND_LOCATION(persistence, location)`.
 * All supported `PSA_KEY_PERSISTENCE_*` and `PSA_KEY_LOCATION_*` values can be combined.
 *
 * In addition to the location values defined by the specification, this implementation also
 * supports values for [Secure Elements](#secure-elements).
 *
 * Configuration {#configuration}
 * ===
 * Currently there are two ways to configure PSA Crypto: Kconfig and Makefiles. An example for both
 * can be found in `RIOT/examples/psa_crypto`.
 *
 * ## Kconfig
 * We recommend using Kconfig and choosing your features in `menuconfig`.
 * You can access the GUI by calling
 *
 * @code
 * TEST_KCONFIG=1 BOARD=<your board> make menuconfig
 * @endcode
 *
 * from your application directory.
 * There you can find the available PSA features and options under `System->PSA Crypto`.
 * If you only select the operations you want to use (e.g. `PSA Ciphers->AES-128 CBC`), Kconfig
 * will automatically select the best backend for you depending on the board (e.g. a hardware
 * accelerator if it is available). Optionally you can force a custom backend.
 *
 * Further you can specify the exact number of keys you need to store (section `PSA Key Management
 * Configuration` in `menuconfig`), or choose your [Secure Element](#secure-elements)
 * configurations.
 *
 * Alternatively you can create an `app.config.test` file in your application folder
 * and choose your symbols there (see `examples/psa_crypto`).
 *
 * In the `app.config.test` file, modules can be chosen with the following syntax:
 * `CONFIG_MODULE_<MODULENAME>=y`, as shown below.
 * @code
 * CONFIG_MODULE_PSA_CRYPTO=y
 * CONFIG_MODULE_PSA_CIPHER=y
 * CONFIG_MODULE_PSA_CIPHER_AES_128_CBC=y
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Makefiles
 * If you don't want to use Kconfig, you can use the traditional way in RIOT of selecting
 * modules in your application Makefile.
 *
 * Here you need to set the base module and individual modules for each operation you need.
 * The example below also chooses a default backend depending on your board.
 * @code
 * // Base module: this is required!
 * USEMODULE += psa_crypto
 *
 * USEMODULE += psa_cipher
 * USEMODULE += psa_cipher_aes_128_cbc
 * @endcode
 *
 * If desired, you can choose a specific backend at compile time. For this you need to specify
 * that you want to set a custom backend and then explicitly choose the one you want (see below).
 * @code
 * USEMODULE += psa_cipher_aes_128_cbc_custom_backend
 * USEMODULE += psa_cipher_aes_128_cbc_backend_riot
 * @endcode
 *
 * The currently available modules, are listed [below](#available-modules).
 *
 * ## Key Slot Types {#configuration-keys}
 * The key management of PSA keeps track of keys by storing them in virtual key slot
 * representations, along with their attributes. Since keys can come in various sizes,
 * it would be inefficient to allocate the same amount of memory for all keys.
 * To reduce the amount of memory used for key storage, PSA internally differentiates between
 * three types of key slots (see below). Depending on the operations your application uses, PSA will
 * automatically detect the key sizes needed and will allocate the required memory.
 * The number of key slots allocated of each type is set to five per default, but can be changed by
 * the user depending on their requirements.
 *
 * | Single Key Slot | Asymmetric Key Slot | Protected Key Slot |
 * |----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
 * | Single keys or unstructured data,<br>e.g. AES keys or asymmetric<br>public keys in local memory | Asymmetric key pairs<br>(private and public parts) <br>in local memory | Any keys stored on a secure<br>element or on-chip in<br>hardware protected memory |
 *
 * If you want to change the default number of allocated key slots you can do so by
 * updating the number in `menuconfig`, or adding them to the `app.config.test` file like so:
 * @code
 * CONFIG_PSA_SINGLE_KEY_COUNT=3
 * CONFIG_PSA_ASYMMETRIC_KEYPAIR_COUNT=1
 * CONFIG_PSA_PROTECTED_KEY_COUNT=2
 * @endcode
 *
 * When using Makefiles, you can pass CFLAGS as shown below.
 * @code
 * CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_PSA_SINGLE_KEY_COUNT=3
 * CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_PSA_ASYMMETRIC_KEYPAIR_COUNT=1
 * CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_PSA_PROTECTED_KEY_COUNT=2
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note    The key slot count defines the maximum number of keys that can be cached in
 *          RAM at runtime. It does not limit the number of persistent keys that can be stored
 *          in flash memory. It is the user's responsibility to keep track of the number of
 *          persistently stored keys.
 *
 * ## Available Modules {#available-modules}
 * Below are the currently available modules.
 * No matter which operation you need, you always have to choose the base module.
 * If you want to specify a backend other than the default, you need to select
 * `psa_<operation>_custom_backend` in addition to the actual backend module.
 *
 * The names listed are are the version used in makefiles with the
 * `USEMODULE += <modulename>` syntax.
 * In Kconfig you don't need to know the exact names, you can simply choose the features in
 * `menuconfig`.
 * When using `app.config.test` files in your application directory, you need to write the
 * names in uppercase and add the prefix `CONFIG_MODULE_` to all of them.

 *
 * Random Number Generation {#rng}
 * ===
 * Currently uses the [RIOT Random Module](#sys_random) as a backend.
 * See the documentation for configuration options.
 *
 * Secure Elements {#secure-elements}
 * ===
 *
 * An example showing the use of SEs can be found in `examples/psa_crypto`.
 *
 * To use secure elements, you first need to assign a static location value to each device,
 * so PSA can find it. If you only use one device, you can use
 * `PSA_KEY_LOCATION_PRIMARY_SECURE_ELEMENT`. For additional devices this value must be within
 * the range of `PSA_KEY_LOCATION_SE_MIN` and `PSA_KEY_LOCATION_SE_MAX`.
 * When booting the system, the `auto_init` module in RIOT will automatically register the device
 * with the location with PSA Crypto.
 *
 * You can now import or create keys on the secure element by constructing a key lifetime containing
 * a device's location value.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 * psa_key_lifetime_t lifetime =
 *      PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_FROM_PERSISTENCE_AND_LOCATION (PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE,
                                                        PSA_KEY_LOCATION_PRIMARY_SECURE_ELEMENT);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Some secure elements come with their own key management and device configurations. In this case
 * the configuration parameters must be passed to PSA Crypto during the registration. For this, you
 * need to define a `psa_se_config_t` structure containing the configuration.
 * PSA Crypto will use this structure to keep track of what types of keys are allowed on the device
 * and how much storage is available.
 * Where this structure should be placed, how it looks and what parameters are required depends
 * on the type of your device.
 *
 * A good place to define that structure and the location values is a drivers `<driver>_params.h`
 * file, but this may vary depending on how your device is integrated in RIOT.
 *
 * For detailed, device specific information, please check the device driver documentation or
 * the example.
 *
 * ## Available Devices and Drivers
 * - ATECCX08A: [Microchip Cryptoauthlib as a PSA backend](#psa-cryptoauthlib)
 *
 * ## Main SE Configuration
 * To use SEs, the appropriate modules must be chosen in Kconfig:
 * @code
 * CONFIG_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT=y
 * CONFIG_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_ATECCX08A=y        // device example
 * CONFIG_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_ATECCX08A_ECC_P256=y
 * @endcode
 *
 * or added to the the Makefile:
 * @code
 * USEMODULE += psa_secure_element
 * USEMODULE += psa_secure_element_ateccx08a        // device example
 * USEMODULE += psa_secure_element_ateccx08a_ecc_p256
 * @endcode
 *
 * This implementation supports the use of one or more secure elements (SE) as backends. In this
 * case the number of used secure elements must be specified (must be at least 2 and at most 255).
 * When using more than one SE, add
 * @code
 * CONFIG_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_MULTIPLE=y
 * CONFIG_PSA_MAX_SE_COUNT=2                    // or any other number between 2 and 255
 * @endcode
 *
 * or, respectively,
 *
 * @code
 * USEMODULE += psa_secure_element_multiple
 * CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_PSA_MAX_SE_COUNT=2        // or any other number between 2 and 255
 * @endcode
 *
 * Porting Guide {#porting-guide}
 * ===
 * This porting guide focuses on how to add your software library or hardware driver
 * as a backend to PSA Crypto without actually touching the PSA implementation.
 * We will provide some [general information](#porting-general) and then some case
 * examples for different kinds of backends:
 * - [Software Libraries](#porting-software)
 * - [Hardware Drivers](#porting-hardware)
 * - [Secure Elements](#porting-secure-elements)
 *
 * Some examples to look at are:
 * - [RIOT hash module](#sys_hashes)
 * - [RIOT cipher module](#sys_crypto)
 * - [Micro-ECC](#pkg_micro_ecc)
 * - [CryptoCell 310 driver](#pkg_driver_cryptocell_310).
 *
 * An example integrating a secure element can be found in the
 * [Cryptoauthlib Package](#pkg_cryptoauthlib).
 *
 * ## General Information {#porting-general}
 * ### Error Values
 * You should always check the status of your function calls and translate your library's or
 * driver's errors to PSA error values (please be as thorough as possible).
 * The PSA Crypto specification describes exactly what kind of error values should be returned
 * by which function. Please read the API documentation and comply with the instructions.
 * We recommend writing a`<mylibrary>_to_psa_error()` function right in the beginning (see for
 * example `CRYS_to_psa_error()` in
 * `pkg/driver_cryptocell_310/psa_cryptocell_310/error_conversion.c`).
 *
 * ### The Build System
 * As mentioned before, there are two ways of selecting build time configurations in RIOT: Kconfig
 * and Makefiles.
 * Kconfig dependency resolution is currently an experimental feature and will at some point
 * replace Makefiles. Until then, our implementation needs to support both, which means we need
 * to define features and symbols in multiple places.
 * Luckily, the modules have the exact same names in both systems, which makes the transfer easier.
 * The examples below show both ways.
 *
 * ### Modules {#module-names}
 * In RIOT, module names are generated from path names, so if you create a directory for
 * your sourcefiles, the module name will be the same as the directory name. It is possible
 * to change that by declaring a new module name in the Makefile by adding the line
 * `MODULE := your_module_name`.
 *
 * If you leave it like this, all sourcefiles in the path corresponding to the module name will be
 * built (e.g. if you choose the module `hashes`, all files in `sys/hashes` will be included).
 * For better configurability it is possible to add submodules (see
 * `sys/hashes/psa_riot_hashes` for example).
 * In that case the base module name will be the directory name and each file inside the directory
 * becomes its own submodule that must be explicitly chosen. The module name will then be the
 * directory name with the file name as a postfix.
 * For example:
 * @code
 * USEMODULE += hashes
 * USEMODULE += psa_riot_hashes
 * USEMODULE += psa_riot_hashes_sha_256
 *
 * will build the file at `sys/hashes/psa_riot_hashes/sha_256.c`, but none of the other files in
 * the directory).
 *
 * To enable submodules for your implementation add the following to the directory makefile:
 * @code
 * BASE_MODULE := psa_<modulename>
 * SUBMODULES := 1
 * @endcode
 *
 * We also need to create so-called pseudomodules for each available submodule.
 * Those must follow the scheme `psa_<modulename>_<filename>`.
 * Where they are declared depends on where your module is located. Pseudomodules in `RIOT/sys` must
 * be added in `pseudomodules.inc.mk`.
 * When integrating packages or drivers, the pseudomodules can be added in the `Makefile.include`
 * file of the individual module's directory (see `pkg/micro-ecc/Makefile.include`).
 *
 * When adding backends to PSA Crypto, please name your modules in ways that fit within the
 * current naming scheme: `psa_<library>_<algorithm>`. Also, when adding software libraries and
 * hardware drivers, use the submodule approach. That makes PSA Crypto more configurable.
 *
 * The drawback of the submodule approach is, that if one of our sourcefiles depends on
 * another sourcefile in the same folder, we need to select it explicitly. For example, in
 * `pkg/driver_cryptocell_310/psa_cryptocell_310` you can see that there are some common source
 * files that all the others use (e.g. for hashes there is a `hashes_common.c` file).
 *
 * If that is the case for your driver, you need to make sure the modules are selected in
 * the Kconfig file as well as the `Makefile.dep` file (see `psa_cryptocell_310/Makefile.dep` or
 * `psa_cryptocell_310/Kconfig`).
 *
 * ### Adding Glue Code {#glue-code}
 * We define a number of wrapper APIs, which are called by PSA to invoke crypto backends.
 * Software libraries and hardware drivers use the same methods, secure elements are handled
 * in a different way (see [Case Example – Secure Elements](#porting-secure-elements) for details).
 *
 * The names, parameters and return values for wrapper methods are defined in header files in
 * `sys/psa_crypto/include/psa_<algorithm>.h`.
 * The functions declared in those files are the ones that are currently supported by this
 * PSA implementation. They will be extended in the future.
 *
 * You need to implement those functions with glue code calling your library or driver code
 * and converting types and error values between PSA and your backend.
 * Below is an example of how this might look (it's very reduced, your library may need
 * much more glue code).
 * @code {.c}
 * psa_status_t psa_ecc_p256r1_sign_hash(const psa_key_attributes_t *attributes,
 *                                       psa_algorithm_t alg, const uint8_t *key_buffer,
 *                                       size_t key_buffer_size, const uint8_t *hash,
 *                                       size_t hash_length, uint8_t *signature,
 *                                       size_t signature_size, size_t *signature_length)
 * {
 *     int status = <libraryname>_<sign_hash_func>(key_buffer, hash, hash_length,
 *                                            signature, signature_length, curve);
 *
 *     if (status != SUCCESS) {
 *         return <libraryname>_status_to_psa_error(status);
 *     }
 *
 *     (void)alg;
 *     (void)attributes;
 *     (void)key_buffer_size;
 *     return PSA_SUCCESS;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## creating glue-code for existing PSA-algorithms {#psa-glue-code}
 * 
 * If you plan to add glue code for algorithms already existing in RIOT, you need to create a new 
 * pseudomodule first. 
 * Afterwards, you can add your glue-functions. The perfect location would be inside the base-module you are glueing to.
 * 
 *
 * Example:
 * When adding glue-code for the PSA_CRYPTO-module, you need to:
 * - add your glue-pseudomodule to `makefiles/pseudomodules.inc.mk`
 * - add your glue-pseudomodule to `makefiles/features_modules.inc.mk`
 * - add your glue-pseudomodule to `makefiles/features_existing.inc.mk`
 * - add your glue-code ( for example in `sys/hashes/psa_riot_hashes/{your_code}`)
 * - add your glue-headers ( for example in `sys/psa_crypto/include/psa_hashes.h`)
 * - add your glue-code-calls to algorithm-dispatcher (in `sys/psa_crypto/psa_crypto_algorithm_dispatch.c`)
 * - add your glue-headers to includes (in `sys/include/hashes/psa/riot_hashes.h`, `sys/include/psa_crypto/psa/crypto_contexts.h`)
 * - update makefiles in `sys/psa_crypto/` (`Makefile.dep`, `Makefile.include`) -> don't forget to add your methods to the doc.txt

 * Please use [`sys/psa_crypto: sha3 support #20698`](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/20698) as a reference.

 * PS: Don't forget to add tests in `tests/sys/{base_module_of_your_glue_code}` ;-) 
 * For the example above, the tests would be placed in: `tests/sys/psa_crypto_hashes` 
 * (don't forget to add your Module to the Makefile inside this folder).
 * You can call them from `tests/sys/psa-psa_crypto_hashes/`. 
 * Please refer to the corresponding manual about running tests for more details.


 * ### Operation Contexts
 * Some cryptographic operations use driver specific context to store the operation state in
 * between function calls. These must be defined somewhere. Examples can be found in
 * `pkg/driver_cryptocell_310/include/psa_periph_hashes_ctx.h` and
 * `sys/include/hashes/psa/riot_hashes.h`.
 *
 * When defining the contexts for a hardware driver, all you need to do is add a file called
 * `psa_periph_<algorithm>_ctx.h` to your driver's include folder and define the available types
 * (see supported [types](#supported-types) below).
 * Those files are automatically included in `crypto_includes.h` and it is important that they
 * always have the same name for each algorithm.
 *
 * When defining the contexts for a software library, the headerfile should be called
 * `<library>_<algorithm>.h` (e.g. `riot_hashes.h`) and must be added to `crypto_includes.h` as
 * shown below:
 * @code
 * #if IS_USED(MODULE_PSA_<LIBRARY>_<ALGORITHM>)
 * #include "<library>/<library>_<algorithm>.h"
 * #endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * When defining the context types, those must always depend on the specific algorithm module,
 * for example
 * @code
 * #if IS_USED(MODULE_PSA_<LIBRARY>_HASHES_SHA_256)
 * #include "path/to/headerfile_containing_the_driver_context_definition"
 *
 * typedef <library_context_type_t> psa_hashes_sha256_ctx_t;
 * #endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * #### Hashes {#supported-types}
 * - `psa_hashes_md5_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_hashes_sha1_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_hashes_sha224_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_hashes_sha256_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_hashes_sha512_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_hashes_sha3_ctx_t`
 *
 * #### Ciphers
 * - `psa_cipher_aes_128_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_cipher_aes_192_ctx_t`
 * - `psa_cipher_aes_256_ctx_t`
 *
 * Secure Elements need their own contexts. For this,
 * see [Case Example – Secure Elements](#porting-secure-elements).
 *
 * ## Adding a Backend
 * The integration of hardware drivers, software libraries and secure element drivers
 * differs a bit. Below we describe the necessary steps for each of them.
 *
 * ### Case Example – A Software Library {#porting-software}
 * Software libraries are the easiest backends, because they are not platform or hardware
 * specific. They can generally run on all platforms in RIOT and we can
 * combine different software backends for different operations (we could, for example,
 * use the Micro-ECC package for ECC NIST curves and the C25519 package for operations with
 * the Curve25519).
 *
 * Let's say we have an imaginary software library called `FancyCrypt` and want to use
 * it as a backend of PSA. We've already added it to RIOT as a third party package in
 * `pkg/fancycrypt`.
 * Our library provides hashes and elliptic curve operations and to make it accessible to
 * PSA Crypto we need to write wrappers for our API calls.
 *
 * First we create a folder called `psa_fancycrypt` in the package directory. Inside we create
 * a file with the name of each operation you want to integrate, e.g. `p256.c` and
 * `hashes_sha_224.c` (when adding operations, remember that the path of the files will also
 * be the [module name](#module-names), so please comply with the current naming scheme).
 *
 * In these files we need to implement the methods that are called by PSA as described
 * [above](#glue-code).
 *
 * #### Adding Makefiles
 * We add a Makefile to the `psa_fancycrypt` folder with the following content:
 * @code {.c}
 * BASE_MODULE := psa_fancycrypt
 * SUBMODULES := 1
 *
 * include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.base
 * @endcode
 *
 * This tells RIOT that the `psa_fancycrypt` module has submodules, which can be selected
 * individually.
 *
 * In `pkg/fancycrypt` we now need to declare explicit pseudomodules in `Makefile.include` and add
 * the `psa_fancycrypt` folder to the source files and the `sys/psa_crypto/include` folder to the
 * includes.
 * These should be dependent on the PSA Crypto module as shown below.
 *
 * @code
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_fancycrypt_%, $(USEMODULE)))
 *     PSEUDOMODULES += psa_fancycrypt_hashes_sha_256
 *     PSEUDOMODULES += psa_fancycrypt_p256
 *     DIRS += $(RIOTPKG)/fancycrypt/psa_fancycrypt
 *     INCLUDES += -I$(RIOTBASE)/sys/psa_crypto/include
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the implementation has any dependencies, they need to be added in `Makefile.dep`, for example:
 * @code
 * USEMODULE += psa_fancycrypt
 * USEMODULE += psa_fancycrypt_error_conversion
 *
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_fancycrypt_hashes_sha1,$(USEMODULE)))
 *   USEMODULE += psa_fancycrypt_hashes_common
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * #### Adding a Kconfig file
 * We add a file called `Kconfig` to the `psa_fancycrypt` folder. Here we declare
 * the modules for Kconfig like so:
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_HASHES_SHA_256
 *     bool
 *     depends on MODULE_PSA_CRYPTO
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT
 *
 * config MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_P256
 *     bool
 *     depends on MODULE_PSA_CRYPTO
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT
 *
 * config MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT
 *     bool
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the implementation has any dependencies, we can select them in this Kconfig file:
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_HASHES_SHA_256
 *     bool
 *     depends on MODULE_PSA_CRYPTO
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_HASHES_COMMON
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_ERROR_CONVERSION
 * @endcode
 *
 * In `pkg/fancycrypt/Kconfig` we need to add the line
 * @code
 * rsource "psa_fancycrypt/Kconfig"
 * @endcode
 * at the bottom.
 *
 * #### Telling PSA Crypto about it
 * To be able to choose `fancycrypt` as a PSA backend, we need to add the option to the Kconfig
 * and Makefiles of the PSA Crypto Module.
 *
 * In `sys/psa_crypto/` we need to modify `Kconfig.asymmetric`, `sys/psa_crypto/Kconfig.hashes`,
 * `Makefile.dep` and `Makefile.include`.
 *
 * To `Kconfig.asymmetric` we need to add
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PSA_ASYMMETRIC_ECC_P256R1_BACKEND_FANCYCRYPT
 *     bool "FancyCrypt Package"
 *     select PACKAGE_FANCYCRYPT
 *     select MODULE_PSA_FANCYCRYPT_P256
 * @endcode
 * This will expose FancyCrypt as a backend option in PSA and then enable all the necessary
 * features, when users select it.
 * You need to do the same thing for the hash operation in `Kconfig.hashes`.
 *
 * To achieve the same thing with Makefiles we need to do this in two places:
 * In `Makefile.include` there are some existing pseudomodules for asymmetric crypto and hashes.
 * There we need to create the backend modules for FancyCrypt by adding
 *
 * @code
 * PSEUDOMODULES += psa_asymmetric_ecc_p256r1_backend_fancycrypt
 * @endcode
 *
 * and
 *
 * @code
 * PSEUDOMODULES += psa_hash_sha_256_backend_fancycrypt
 * @endcode
 *
 * The automatic module selection happens in `Makefile.dep`. To the place where exiting P256 curves
 * and hashes are selected we add cases for our backend modules:
 *
 * @code
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_asymmetric_ecc_p256r1_backend_fancycrypt,$(USEMODULE)))
 *     USEPKG += fancycrypt
 *     USEMODULE += psa_fancycrypt
 *     USEMODULE += psa_fancycrypt_p256
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now you should be able to select your package as a backend for PSA Crypto and use it to perform
 * operations.
 *
 * ### Case Example – A Hardware Driver {#porting-hardware}
 * The first steps of porting a hardware driver are the same as for the software library.
 * Only we skip the last part where we add the modules to the PSA Crypto Kconfig and Makefiles
 * and do something else instead.
 *
 * Hardware drivers are treated a little differently, mostly because they are tied to a specific
 * platform and users can not just choose a different driver for their accelerator.
 * Therefore we just want PSA Crypto to automatically use this driver whenever it runs on the
 * corresponding platform, which means that we have to add some additional options and features,
 * not only to the driver but also to the CPU it belongs to.
 * A good example for this is the [CryptoCell 310 driver](#pkg_driver_cryptocell_310) for the
 * accelerator on the [nRF52840 CPU](#cpu_nrf52).
 *
 * Now, let's say we have a CPU called `myCPU` with an on-chip accelerator called
 * `speedycrypt`. Let's say that `speedycrypt` provides hashes and ECC curves.
 * The vendor provides a driver, which we already have included in RIOT as a package.
 * Also we've followed the steps in the [glue code section](#glue-code) and provide a folder called
 * `pkg/driver_speedycrypt/psa_speedycrypt` with the required wrapper files.
 * We have also added the module names in a Kconfig file and in the Makefiles.
 *
 * #### Telling PSA Crypto about it
 * This is where we diverge from the software library example. If you take a look at the available
 * backends in PSA, you'll notice one with the postfix `*_BACKEND_PERIPH` for each available
 * algorithm. **Periph** here is short for *peripheral hardware accelerator*.
 * The `*_BACKEND_PERIPH` modules depend on the presence of such an accelerator. They are a generic
 * module for all crypto hardware accelerators and will automatically resolve to the driver that is
 * associated with the available accelerator.
 *
 * Before we're able to use it we need to tell RIOT that those hardware features exist for
 * our `myCPU` (see `cpu/nrf52/Kconfig` and `cpu/nrf52/Makefile.features` as an example).
 * In `cpu/myCPU` we add all the provided features as shown below.
 *
 * Files we need to touch:
 * - `cpu/myCPU/Makefile.features`
 * - `cpu/myCPU/Kconfig`
 * - `cpu/myCPU/periph/Makefile.dep`
 * - `cpu/myCPU/periph/Kconfig`
 * - When defining new features: `RIOT/kconfigs/Kconfig.features`
 *
 * **cpu/myCPU/Makefile.features:**
 * @code
 * FEATURES_PROVIDED += periph_speedycrypt      // General feature for the accelerator
 * FEATURES_PROVIDED += periph_hash_sha_256
 * FEATURES_PROVIDED += periph_ecc_p256r1
 * @endcode
 *
 * **cpu/myCPU/Kconfig:**
 * @code
 * config CPU_FAM_MYCPU
 *     bool
 *     select CPU_SOME_FEATURES
 *      ...
 *     select HAS_PERIPH_HASH_SHA_256
 *     select HAS_PERIPH_ECC_P256R1
 *     select HAS_PERIPH_SPEEDYCRYPT
 * @endcode
 * The `HAS_PERIPH_*` symbols are defined in ``. If your device
 * provides capabilities that are not yet defined, you can add them to that file.
 *
 * Next we need to define selectable modules for this in the `cpu/myCPU/periph` folder, which
 * then automatically enable the driver. An example for this is `cpu/nrf52/periph`.
 * We add the following to the `cpu/myCPU/periph/Kconfig` file and `cpu/myCPU/periph/Makefile.dep`:
 *
 * **cpu/myCPU/periph/Makefile.dep:**
 * @code
 * ifneq (,$(filter periph_hash_sha_256,$(USEMODULE)))
 *     USEPKG += driver_speedycrypt
 *     USEMODULE += psa_speedycrypt_hashes_sha256
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * **cpu/myCPU/periph/Kconfig:**
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PERIPH_FANCYCRYPT
 *     bool
 *     depends on HAS_PERIPH_FANCYCRYPT
 *     select PACKAGE_DRIVER_FANCYCRYPT
 *
 * config MODULE_PERIPH_HASH_SHA_256
 *     bool
 *     depends on HAS_PERIPH_HASH_SHA_256
 *     select MODULE_PERIPH_SPEEDYCRYPT
 *     select MODULE_PSA_SPEEDYCRYPT_HASHES_SHA256
 * @endcode
 *
 * Here we basically say "If the user chooses the `periph_hash_sha_256 module`, also select the
 * `periph_speedycrypt` feature, which will then enable the speedycrypt driver". Of course you need
 * to do this for all your available features.
 *
 * Now, if you build PSA Crypto with default configurations, it should automatically detect that
 * your board has a hardware accelerator for hashes and ECC operations and build the hardware
 * driver as a backend.
 *
 * ### Case Example – A Secure Element Driver {#porting-secure-elements}
 * Secure elements (SEs) are handled almost completely separate from the other backends. When we use
 * software libraries or hardware drivers, we only build one implementation per algorithm.
 * When it comes to secure elements we want to be able to build them in addition to the other
 * backends and we may want to connect and use more than one of them at the same time.
 * Another difference is that when using software libraries and hardware drivers, PSA handles the
 * storage of key material. When using SEs, keys are stored on the SE, which means, we need
 * additional functionality for the key management.
 *
 * An existing example in RIOT is the Microchip ATECCX08A device family, whose driver can be found
 * in `pkg/cryptoauthlib`.
 *
 * PSA Crypto has an integrated SE driver registry, which stores all registered drivers in a list.
 * When an application calls a cryptographic operation that's supposed to be performed by a secure
 * element, the registry will find the correct driver in the list and PSA will invoke the operation.
 * Each driver is stored with a context that contains persistent as well as transient driver data.
 * Transient driver data can be anything the driver needs to function. Persistent data is supposed
 * to be used to keep track of how many keys are stored on the device and if there is still some
 * free space available.
 *
 * @note    Currently PSA does not support persistent storage, so the persistent driver data
 *          is not really persistent, yet. Once persistent storage is implemented, this data
 *          will be stored, so the implementation can find already existing keys again after
 *          a reboot.
 *
 * For this example we integrate an imaginary SE called `superSE`, which comes with a driver called
 * `superSE_lib`. Again, we assume that we have already added the driver as a package in RIOT and it
 * can be found at `pkg/superse_lib`.
 *
 * #### Adding the Glue Code
 * Secure element drivers need to implement a different API than the other backends. It is defined
 * [here](#sys_psa_crypto_se_driver).
 * In our package folder we now create a new folder called `psa_superse_driver` and add a source
 * file called `psa_superse_lib_driver.c`. Here we now implement glue code for all the cryptographic
 * operations our SE supports.
 *
 * You will notice that the SE interface also provides some key management functions. This is
 * because keys are stored on the device and PSA can not access the memory and key data itself,
 * but needs to tell the driver to do it.
 *
 * ### Operation Contexts
 * Some operations need driver specific contexts. For secure elements these are wrapped in types
 * defined in `crypto_contexts.h` (currently only `psa_se_cipher_context_t` is supported).
 * In this header file add operation contexts that belong to your driver to the available SE
 * context unions as shown in the example below:
 *
 * @code
 * typedef struct {
 *     union driver_context {
 *         unsigned dummy;
 *     #if IS_USED(MODULE_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_ATECCX08A) || defined(DOXYGEN)
 *         atca_aes_cbc_ctx_t atca_aes_cbc;
 *     #endif
 *     #if IS_USED(MODULE_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_SUPERSE) || defined(DOXYGEN)
 *         superse_cipher_ctx_t superse_aes_cbc;
 *     #endif
 *     } drv_ctx;
 * } psa_se_cipher_context_t;
 * @endcode
 *
 * #### Allocation
 * The first thing PSA will do, when an application creates a key on an SE, is ask the driver to
 * find a free key slot on the device. This is what the `allocate` function is for. How exactly
 * the slot is allocated, depends on the driver.
 * It may be possible to query that information directly from the device. If that is not possible,
 * we can use the persistent data stored in the driver context. An example for this can be
 * found in `pkg/cryptoauthlib/psa_atca_driver/psa_atca_se_driver.c`.
 * This example requires the user to provide information about the configurations for each key slot,
 * which is then stored in the persistent driver data and used for key management (for a better
 * description read [Using Cryptoauthlib as a backend for PSA Crypto](#psa-cryptoauthlib)).
 * At this point you can decide what the best approach for your device is.
 *
 * The `allocate` function should then return some reference to the slot it has allocated
 * for the key (possibly a pointer or a slot number). Next PSA Crypto will invoke the `import`
 * or `generate` function to store a key.
 *
 * #### Using Persistent Data
 * When you want to use persistent data to keep track of keys, you should utilize the
 * `psa_se_config_t` structure, which is declared in `crypto_se_config.h`.
 * You can define a structure that can hold your device configuration and make sure it is available
 * then your SE is used.
 *
 * #### Making the Methods Available
 * At the bottom of the wrapper code, define structures with pointers to the available methods.
 * For example if you have implemented a `superse_allocate` and `superse_generate_key` function,
 * you need to add a `psa_drv_se_key_management_t` structure as shown below. Fill the unimplemented
 * methods with `NULL` pointers.
 * The last structure should be a `psa_drv_se_t` struct containing pointers to the other structures.
 * That one will be stored during driver registration to get access to all the implemented
 * functions.
 *
 * @code {.c}
 * static psa_drv_se_key_management_t superse_key_management = {
 *     .p_allocate = superse_allocate,
 *     .p_validate_slot_number = NULL,
 *     .p_import = NULL,
 *     .p_generate = superse_generate_key,
 *     .p_destroy = NULL,
 *     .p_export = NULL,
 *     .p_export_public = NULL
 * };
 *
 * psa_drv_se_t superse_methods = {
 *     .hal_version = PSA_DRV_SE_HAL_VERSION,
 *     .persistent_data_size = 0,
 *     .p_init = NULL,
 *     .key_management = &superse_key_management,
 *     .mac = NULL,
 *     .cipher = NULL,
 *     .aead = NULL,
 *     .asymmetric = NULL,
 *     .derivation = NULL
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * You should do this for all available functions. The structures for the functions are
 * declared in `sys/psa_crypto/include/psa_crypto_se_driver.h`.
 *
 * #### Driver Registration
 * At start-up all secure element drivers need to be registered with the PSA SE management module.
 * This happens by calling `psa_register_secure_element()` during the automatic driver
 * initialization in RIOT.
 * When you added support for our device to RIOT, you should have implemented an
 * `auto_init_<device>` function, which initializes the connected devices.
 * In this function, after initializing a device, you should call `psa_register_secure_element()`
 * and pass the device's location value, and pointers to the `psa_drv_se_t` structure,
 * the persistent data and some device specific context.
 * An example implementation of this can be seen in `sys/auto_init/security/auto_init_atca.c`.
 *
 * #### Telling PSA Crypto about it
 * To be able to choose our `superSE` during configuration, we need to define the corresponding
 * modules in the Kconfig files and Makefiles.
 *
 * To `pkg/super_se_lib/Kconfig` we add something like
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PSA_SUPERSE_DRIVER
 *     bool
 *     depends on PACKAGE_SUPERSE_LIB
 *     default y if MODULE_PSA_CRYPTO
 *     select PSA_KEY_MANAGEMENT
 * @endcode
 * This tells the build system that whenever this driver and PSA Crypto are used at the same time,
 * the wrapper and the PSA key management module are needed, too.
 *
 * To `sys/psa_crypto/psa_se_mgmt/Kconfig` we add a menu for the SE like so:
 * @code
 * menuconfig MODULE_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_SUPERSE
 *     bool "Our Vendor's SuperSE"
 *     select PACKAGE_SUPERSE_LIB
 *     depends on <whatever protocol is needed for communication, e.g. HAS_PERIPH_I2C>
 *     help
 *         <Some helpful information about this module>
 * @endcode
 * This makes our driver selectable whenever an application configuration selects the PSA secure
 * element module.
 *
 * As described in the [Configuration Section](#configuration-keys), references to keys on secure
 * elements are stored by PSA in a different type of key slot than other keys.
 * The slot for protected keys usually only contains a slot number or address and not the actual
 * key, which requires a lot less memory space.
 *
 * **BUT:** If your secure element supports asymmetric cryptography and exports a public key part
 * during key generation, that key part must be stored somewhere. So when you choose an
 * asymmetric operation, the protected key slots will have the space to store a public
 * key.
 *
 * #### Dependencies
 * Secure Element operations also depend on the PSA modules. E.g. when you want to use an ECC
 * operation, you need to make sure that you also build the asymmetric PSA functions.
 *
 * For this we need to add the following to the `superSE` menu:
 * @code
 * config MODULE_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_SUPERSE_ECC_P256
 *     bool "Our Vendor's Elliptic Curve P256"
 *     select PSA_KEY_SIZE_256
 *     select MODULE_PSA_ASYMMETRIC
 *     depends on MODULE_PSA_SECURE_ELEMENT_SUPERSE
 * @endcode
 * This tells us, what size a key slot should have to store the public key. If your SE supports
 * other curves, you need to modify this accordingly or add more of them.
 *
 * Now we need to add the same to the Makefiles. In `Makefile.include` we add the source file path
 * and the PSA include folders and define the new available pseudomodules:
 * @code
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_crypto,$(USEMODULE)))
 *     DIRS += $(RIOTPKG)/superse_lib/psa_superse_driver
 *     INCLUDES += -I$(RIOTBASE)/sys/psa_crypto/include
 *     PSEUDOMODULES += psa_secure_element_superse
 *     PSEUDOMODULES += psa_secure_element_superse_ecc_p256
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * In `Makefile.dep` we automatically add required modules when PSA Crypto and the ECC curve
 * module are chosen:
 * @code
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_crypto,$(USEMODULE)))
 *   USEMODULE += psa_superse_driver
 * endif
 *
 * ifneq (,$(filter psa_secure_element_superse_ecc_p256, $(USEMODULE)))
 *   USEMODULE += psa_asymmetric
 * endif
 * @endcode
 * This needs to be done for all other supported operations (e.g. ATECCX08 operations in
 * `pkg/cryptoauthlib/Makefile.include`, `pkg/cryptoauthlib/Makefile.dep` and
 * `sys/psa_crypto/psa_se_mgmt/Kconfig`. Now the secure element should be available for use
 * with PSA Crypto.
