 * @details     This header declares types and function signatures for cryptography
 *              drivers that access key material via opaque references.
 *              This is meant for cryptoprocessors that have a separate key storage from the
 *              space in which the PSA Crypto implementation runs, typically secure
 *              elements (SEs).
 *
 *              This file is part of the PSA Crypto Driver HAL (hardware abstraction layer),
 *              containing functions for driver developers to implement to enable hardware
 *              to be called in a standardized way by a PSA Cryptography API
 *              implementation. The functions comprising the driver HAL, which driver
 *              authors implement, are not intended to be called by application developers.

    /**
     * A read-only pointer to the driver's persistent data.
     *
     * Drivers typically use this persistent data to keep track of
     * which slot numbers are available. This is only a guideline:
     * drivers may use the persistent data for any purpose, keeping
     * in mind the restrictions on when the persistent data is saved
     * to storage: the persistent data is only saved after calling
     * certain functions that receive a writable pointer to the
     * persistent data.
     *
     * The core allocates a memory buffer for the persistent data.
     * The pointer is guaranteed to be suitably aligned for any data type,
     * like a pointer returned by @c malloc (but the core can use any
     * method to allocate the buffer, not necessarily @c malloc).
     *
     * The size of this buffer is in the @c persistent_data_size field of
     * this structure.
     *
     * Before the driver is initialized for the first time, the content of
     * the persistent data is all-bits-zero. After a driver upgrade, if the
     * size of the persistent data has increased, the original data is padded
     * on the right with zeros; if the size has decreased, the original data
     * is truncated to the new size.
     *
     * This pointer is to read-only data. Only a few driver functions are
     * allowed to modify the persistent data. These functions receive a
     * writable pointer. These functions are:
     * - @ref psa_drv_se_t::p_init
     * - @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_allocate
     * - @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy
     *
     * The PSA Cryptography core saves the persistent data from one
     * session to the next. It does this before returning from API functions
     * that call a driver method that is allowed to modify the persistent
     * data, specifically:
     * - @ref psa_crypto_init() causes a call to @ref psa_drv_se_t::p_init, and may call
     *   @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy to complete an action that was
     *   interrupted by a power failure.
     * - Key creation functions cause a call to @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_allocate,
     *   and may cause a call to @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy in case an error
     *   occurs.
     * - @ref psa_destroy_key() causes a call to @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy.

/**
 * @brief   A function that allocates a slot for a key.
 *
 * @details To create a key in a specific slot in a secure element, the core first calls this
 *          function to determine a valid slot number, then calls a function to create the key
 *          material in that slot. In nominal conditions (that is, if no error occurs), the effect
 *          of a call to a key creation function in the PSA Cryptography API with a lifetime that
 *          places the key in a secure element is the following:
 *          -# The core calls @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_allocate
 *             (or in some implementations @ref
 *             psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_validate_slot_number). The driver selects (or
 *             validates) a suitable slot number given the key attributes and the state of the
 *             secure element.
 *          -# The core calls a key creation function in the driver.
 *
 *          The key creation functions in the PSA Cryptography API are:
 *          - @ref psa_import_key(), which causes a call to @c p_allocate with
 *            @c method = @ref PSA_KEY_CREATION_IMPORT then a call to
 *            @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_import.
 *          - @ref psa_generate_key(), which causes a call to @c p_allocate with
 *            @c method = @ref PSA_KEY_CREATION_GENERATE then a call to
 *            @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_import.
 *          - @ref psa_key_derivation_output_key(), which causes a call to @c p_allocate with
 *            @p method = @ref PSA_KEY_CREATION_DERIVE then a call to
 *            @ref psa_drv_se_key_derivation_t::p_derive.
 *          - @ref psa_copy_key(), which causes a call to @c p_allocate with
 *            @p method = @ref PSA_KEY_CREATION_COPY then a call to
 *            @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_export.
 *
 *          In case of errors, other behaviors are possible.
 *          - If the PSA Cryptography subsystem dies after the first step, for example because the
 *            device has lost power abruptly, the second step may never happen, or may happen after
 *            a reset and re-initialization. Alternatively, after a reset and re-initialization,
 *            the core may call @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy on the slot number that
 *            was allocated (or validated) instead of calling a key creation function.
 *          - If an error occurs, the core may call @ref psa_drv_se_key_management_t::p_destroy on
 *            the slot number that was allocated (or validated) instead of calling a key creation
 *            function.
 *
 *          Errors and system resets also have an impact on the driver's persistent
 *          data. If a reset happens before the overall key creation process is
 *          completed (before or after the second step above), it is unspecified
 *          whether the persistent data after the reset is identical to what it
 *          was before or after the call to @c p_allocate (or @c p_validate_slot_number).
 *
 * @param   drv_context     The driver context structure.
 * @param   persistent_data A pointer to the persistent data

 *          writing it to the @c pubkey buffer.
 *          This is optional, intended for secure elements that output the public key at generation
 *          time and that cannot export the public key later. Drivers that do not need this feature
 *          should leave @c *pubkey_length set to 0 and should implement the
 *          @c p_export_public function. Some implementations do not
 *          support this feature, in which case @c pubkey is @c NULL and @c pubkey_size is 0.
 *
 * @param   drv_context     The driver context structure.
 * @param   key_slot        Slot where the key will be stored. This must be a valid slot for a key
 *                          of the chosen type. It must be unoccupied.
 * @param   attributes      The key attributes, including the lifetime, the key type and size, and
 *                          the usage policy. Drivers can call @ref psa_get_key_lifetime(),

 *                          @ref psa_get_key_usage_flags() and @ref psa_get_key_algorithm() to
 *                          access this information.
 * @param   pubkey          A buffer where the driver can write the public key, when generating an
 *                          asymmetric key pair. This is @c NULL when generating a symmetric key or
 *                          if the core does not support exporting the public key at generation
 *                          time.
 * @param   pubkey_size     The size of the @c pubkey buffer in bytes. This is 0 when generating a
 *                          symmetric key or if the core does not support exporting the public key
 *                          at generation time.
 * @param   pubkey_length   On entry, this is always 0. On success, the number of bytes written to
 *                          @c pubkey. If this is 0 or unchanged on return, the core will not read
 *                          the @c pubkey buffer, and will instead call the driver's
 *                          @c p_export_public function to export the
 *                          public key when needed.

/**
 * @defgroup    driver_derivation Secure Element Key Derivation and Agreement
 *
 * @details     Key derivation is the process of generating new key material using an
 *              existing key and additional parameters, iterating through a basic
 *              cryptographic function, such as a hash.
 *              Key agreement is a part of cryptographic protocols that allows two parties
 *              to agree on the same key value, but starting from different original key
 *              material.
 *              The flows are similar, and the PSA Crypto Driver Model uses the same functions
 *              for both of the flows.
 *
 *              There are two different final functions for the flows,
 *              @c psa_drv_se_key_derivation_derive and @c psa_drv_se_key_derivation_export.
 *              @c psa_drv_se_key_derivation_derive is used when the key material should be
 *              placed in a slot on the hardware and not exposed to the caller.
 *              @c psa_drv_se_key_derivation_export is used when the key material should be
 *              returned to the PSA Cryptographic API implementation.
 *
 *              Different key derivation algorithms require a different number of inputs.
 *              Instead of having an API that takes as input variable length arrays, which
 *              can be problemmatic to manage on embedded platforms, the inputs are passed
 *              to the driver via a function, @c psa_drv_se_key_derivation_collateral, that
 *              is called multiple times with different @c collateral_ids. Thus, for a key
 *              derivation algorithm that required 3 parameter inputs, the flow would look
 *              something like:
 *
 *              @code
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_setup(kdf_algorithm, source_key,
 *                                              dest_key_size_bytes);
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_collateral(kdf_algorithm_collateral_id_0,
*                                                    p_collateral_0,
*                                                    collateral_0_size);
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_collateral(kdf_algorithm_collateral_id_1,
 *                                                   p_collateral_1,
 *                                                   collateral_1_size);
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_collateral(kdf_algorithm_collateral_id_2,
 *                                                   p_collateral_2,
 *                                                   collateral_2_size);
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_derive();
 *              @endcode
 *
 *              key agreement example:
 *              @code
 *              psa_drv_se_key_derivation_setup(alg, source_key. dest_key_size_bytes);
