 * @defgroup    sys_crypto Crypto
 * @brief       RIOT provides a collection of block cipher ciphers, different
   operation modes and cryptographic hash algorithms.
 *
 * \section ciphers Ciphers
 *
 * Riot supports the following block ciphers:
 *  * AES-128
 *  * 3DES
 *  * Twofish
 *  * Skipjack
 *  * NULL
 *
 * You can use them directly by adding "crypto" to your USEMODULE-List.
 * While you can use the ciphers functions directly, you should resort to
 * the generic API for block ciphers whenever possible.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 *  #include "crypto/ciphers.h"
 *
 *  ciphter_t cipher;
 *  uint8_t key[16] = {0}, plain_text[16] = {0}, cipher_text[16] = {0};
 *
 *  if (cipher_init(&cipher, CIPHER_AES_128, key, key_len) < 0)
 *      printf("Cipher init failed!\n");
 *
 *  if (cipher_encrypt(&cipher, plain_text, cipher_text) < 0)
 *      printf("Cipher encryption!\n");
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you need to encrypt data of arbitrary size take a look at the different
 * operation modes like: CBC, CTR or CCM.
 *
 * Additional examples can be found in the test suite.
 *
 * \section hashes Hashes
 *
 * RIOT currently supports sha256 as a cryptographic hash implementation.
