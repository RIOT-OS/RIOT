        This module provides wrappers for malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and
        free() which guarantee mutually exclusive access to heap data
        structures. This linker is also instructed to redirect all calls to
        the corresponding wrappers. As a result, all allocations become thread
        safe without touching the application code or the c library. This module
        is intended to be pulled in automatically if needed. Hence, applications
        never should manually use it.
