 *
 * Writing an ADC NG Backend
 * =========================
 *
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 *
 * - **Single Ended Input:** The ADC converts a single input voltage into
 *   an unsigned value in which zero refers to 0V and the highest value
 *   indicates that the input is equal to (or higher than) the reference
 *   voltage.
 * - **Differential Input:** The ADC use a positive and a negative input
 *   and converts the voltage difference between the two into a signed value:
 *   A value of zero indicates no voltage difference, a positive value that the
 *   positive inputs is greater than the negative, and a negative value that
 *   the negative inputs is greater than the positive. If the difference is
 *   equal to the reference voltage, the highest (or lowest) value is returned.
 *
 * Channel Mapping
 * ---------------
 *
 * Every ADC driver must at least one single ended input. All other channel
 * types are optional. The initialization code in @ref adc_ng_driver_t::init
 * must however be prepared to be called for every possible channel number and
 * must return `-ENXIO` for unsupported channels. The channel number of the
 * highest single ended channel must be given in the driver in
 * @ref adc_ng_driver_t::highest_single_ended_channel. All channel numbers
 * below this *must* also refer to single ended channels.
 *
 * Channels above the value given in
 * @ref adc_ng_driver_t::highest_single_ended_channel but below 224 are driver
 * specific and can be used to provide access to differential inputs, select
 * different gains, etc.
 *
 * Channels starting from 224 are reserved for driver independent special
 * channels. Those special channels currently are @ref ADC_NG_CHAN_FIXED_REF
 * (to select a fixed reference voltage as input to allow measuring the value
 * of other reference voltages), @ref ADC_NG_CHAN_NTC (that refers to an
 * internally connected integrated thermistor), and @ref ADC_NG_CHAN_ENTROPY
 * (to collect entropy).

/**
 * @brief   This special channel must refer to an internal fixed reference
 *          voltage used as input
 *
 * ADCs not supporting this will return `-ERANGE` when this channel is
 * selected. If this is supported, it can be used to measure the correct value
 * of voltage references depending on supply voltages (including the MCUs
 * supply voltage, if selectable as reference voltage). This allows to
 * compensate for differences between nominal and actual voltage reference
 * during conversion to physical units.
 *
 * In case of boards running directly of a battery, measuring the supply
 * voltage is particularly useful to estimate the remaining battery charge.
