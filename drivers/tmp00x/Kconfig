        TMP006/TMP007 allows for up to 8 devices on a single bus. The address
        value depends on the state of ADR0 and ADR1 pins. Default value (0x40)
        corresponds to ADR0 and ADR1 pins tied to GND. For more information
        refer to the 'Serial Bus Address' section in the datasheet.

        The duration of the analog-to-digital(A/D) conversion is determined by
        the conversion rate bits CR0, CR1 and CR2. For more information refer

        Enable this to put the device in low power mode between measurements.
        By default the device will always be on. Enabling this also adds a delay
        based on "Conversion time" to each measurement call for bringing the
        device out of standby.

    help
        Enable this to return raw ADC readings. By default measurements are
        converted to Celsius.
