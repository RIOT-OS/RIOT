        If you have other MTD devices defined, set this number so that
        the auto-configured SD Card(s) from mtd_sdcard_default will come after them.

    help
        Enable this to erase sector before a data write operation.
        SDCards handle sector erase internally so its
        possible to directly write to the card without erasing
        the sector first hence this feature is disabled by default.
