        Configure the MTD_SDCARD driver using Kconfig.

    bool "Enable SD card erase"
    help
        Enable this to erase sector before a data write operation.
        SDCards handle sector erase internally so it's
        possible to directly write to the card without erasing
        the sector first hence this feature is disabled by default.
