 * sheet).
 *
 * If the crystal was off (only in above mentioned states), the MCU must wait
 * for the transceiver to become ready *before* any SPI transfer is initiated.
 * In all other states, CS pin can be pulled low and SPI transfer can start
 * right away (see section 10 on page 29 in the data sheet). This driver will
 * never disable the transceivers crystal, so this function has to be called
 * only once when the transceiver is powered on.
 *
 * The transceiver will signal that it is available by pulling the MISO pin
 * low (section 10 on page 29 in the data sheet), which does not take longer
 * than 150 microseconds (see Table 22 on page 30 in the data sheet). Instead
 * of messing with the SPI interface, this driver simply waits for this upper
 * bound, as suggested in the note below Table 22 on page 30 in the data sheet.
