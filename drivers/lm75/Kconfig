    help
        The LM75A and TMP1075 allow for up to 8 and 32 devices, respectively, on a single bus.
        The address value depends on the state of the A0, A1 and A2 pins.
        Default value (0x48) corresponds to A0, A1 and A2 pins all connected to GND.
        For more information refer to the 'Slaves Address' section in the datasheet.

        Defines whether the device operates is comparator or interrupt mode.
        The main difference between the two modes is that in comparator mode, the OS output becomes active
        when Temp has exceeded T_OS and reset when Temp has dropped below T_hyst, reading a register or
        putting the device into shutdown mode does not change the state of the OS output; while in interrupt mode,
        once it has been activated either by exceeding T_OS or dropping below T_hyst the OS output will remain active
        indefinitely until reading a register, then the OS output is reset.
        For more information please refer to the datasheet.
