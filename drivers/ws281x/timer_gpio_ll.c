 * @{
 *
 * @file
 * @brief       Implementation of the WS281x abstraction based on GPIO_LL and timers
 *
 * When this is used, the whole @ref ws281x_write_buffer operation is conducted
 * in a single interrupts-disabled run. As it takes about 1us per bit (eg.
 * 0.3ms on a 100-LED strip), the use of this module needs to be carefully
 * evaluated against other real-time requirements.
 *
 * (Letting the trailing pause run with interrupts enabled, or even enabling
 * interrupts between bits, is an option that is being considered for future
 * expansion).
