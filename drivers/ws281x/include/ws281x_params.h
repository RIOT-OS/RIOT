 *
 * A single timer is configured for any number of WS281x strands, so this does
 * not need to be part of params.
 *
 * It is required that the timer has at least 2 channels. (Future versions may
 * require a 3rd channel).
 *
 * It is required that the timer's MAX_VALUE is 2^n-1, which is a trivial but
 * not explicitly stated case.
 *
 * This timer is configured at WS281x initialization time, and kept stopped
 * outside of transmissions.
 *
 * The default value of 2 is chosen because the only platform on which the
 * module is usable is nRF5x, where TIMER_DEV(1) is in use by the radio module.
 * It is strongly advised to explicitly set this timer to a known free timer,
 * as the default may change without notice.
