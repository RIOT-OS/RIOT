        help
            In Hold mode the measurement is started and the sensor blocks the
            master by clock stretching until the measurement is finished. Thus,
            in this mode, both the I2C bus and the processor are blocked for the
            entire measurement duration, which can be up to 85 ms for temperature
            measurement and up to 29 ms for humidity measurement, depending on the
            resolution. Therefore, the no-hold mode should be used, where the
            measurement is started and a timer is used to fetch the results.
            This way neither the I2C bus nor the processor are blocked for the
            duration of the measurement. Furthermore, the hold mode requires that
            the MCU supports clock stretching.
