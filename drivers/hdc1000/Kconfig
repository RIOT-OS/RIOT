        HDC1000 allows for up to 4 devices on single bus. The value depends on
        the state of ADR1 and ADR0 pins.
        For more information refer to the section 8.5.1 in the Datasheet (SNAS643C).

        This time value is chosen twice as large as needed for two 14-bit
        conversions (worst case) to allow for timer imprecision:
        (convert temp + convert hum) * 2 -> (6.5ms + 6.5ms) * 2 := 26ms.
