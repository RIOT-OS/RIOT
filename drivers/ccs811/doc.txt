### <a name="about"> About the sensor </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

The CCS811 is an ultra-low power digital sensor which detects **Volatile
Organic Compounds (VOC)** for **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)** monitoring that.
The sensor allows to

- convert raw sensor data to Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC)
  and equivalent CO2 (eCO2),
- compensate gas readings due to temperature and humidity using an
  external sensor,
- trigger interrupts when new measurement results are available or
  eCO2 value exceeds thresholds,
- correct baseline automatically or manually
- connect a NTC thermistor to provide means of calculating the local
  ambient temperature,
- power-save using a sleep mode and wakeup feature.

@note The sensor is connected to I2C interface and uses clock stretching.
The I2C implementation of the MCU has to support clock stretching
to get CCS811 working.

### <a name="supported"> Supported Features </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

@note There are two driver module versions, the `ccs811` module
which provides only basic functionality and the `ccs811_full`
module with additional functionality.

The `ccs811_full` module includes the `ccs811` module
automatically. If code size is critical, the `ccs811` module can
be used, otherwise using the `ccs811_full` module is recommended.

The driver supports the following features when modules `ccs811`
and `ccs811_full` are used.

Feature | Module
--------|-------
read raw and converted gas sensor data (eCO2, TVOC) | `ccs811`
poling for new sensor gas data | `ccs811`
power saving using sleep mode with wakeup | `ccs811`
data ready and threshold interrupt handling | `ccs811_full`
ambient temperature calculation with NTC | `ccs811_full`
compensate gas readings using an external sensor | `ccs811_full`
manual baseline handling | `ccs811_full`

## <a name="measurement_process"> Measurement Process </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

### <a name="sensor_modes"> Sensor modes </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

After power up, the sensor starts automatically in *Idle, Low Current
Mode* (#CCS811_MODE_IDLE). To start periodic measurements, the mode of
the sensor has to be changed to any measurement mode. Measurement modes
with different output data rates are available:

Mode                         | Driver symbol      | Period | RAW data | IAQ values
-----------------------------| ------------------ | ------ |:--------:|:----------:
Idle, Low Current Mode       | #CCS811_MODE_IDLE  | -      | -        | -
Constant Power Mode          | #CCS811_MODE_1S    | 1 s    | X        | X
Pulse Heating Mode           | #CCS811_MODE_10S   | 10 s   | X        | X
Low Power Pulse Heating Mode | #CCS811_MODE_60S   | 60 s   | X        | X
Constant Power Mode          | #CCS811_MODE_250MS | 250 ms | X        | -

In *Constant Power Mode* with measurements every 250 ms (#CCS811_MODE_250MS)
only raw data are available. In all other measurement modes, the Indoor
Air Quality (IAQ) values are available additionally. The *Constant Power
Mode* with measurements every 250 ms (#CCS811_MODE_250MS) is only intended
for systems where an external host system wants to run an algorithm with
raw data.

@note
- After setting the mode, the sensor is in conditioning period that needs
  up to 20 minutes, before accurate readings are generated, see the
  [data sheet](https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/CCS811_DS000459_6-00.pdf/c7091525-c7e5-37ac-eedb-b6c6828b0dcf)
  for more details.
- During the early-live (burn-in) period, the CCS811 sensor should run
  for 48 hours in the selected mode of operation to ensure sensor
  performance is stable, see the data sheet for more details.
- When the sensor operating mode is changed to a new mode with a lower
  sample rate, e.g., from *Pulse Heating Mode* (#CCS811_MODE_10S)
  to *Low Power Pulse Heating Mode* (#CCS811_MODE_60S), it should be placed
  in *Idle, Low Current  Mode* (#CCS811_MODE_IDLE) for at least 10 minutes
  before enabling the new mode. When the sensor operating mode is changed
  to a new mode with a higher sample rate, e.g., from
  *Low Power Pulse Heating Mode* (#CCS811_MODE_60S) to *Pulse Heating Mode*
  (#CCS811_MODE_10S), there is no requirement to wait before enabling
  the new mode.

When default configuration parameters from **ccs811_params.h** are used,
the #CCS811_MODE_1S measurement mode is used automatically. The
application can change the measurement mode either

- by using the #ccs811_set_mode function, or
- by defining **CCS811_PARAM_MODE** before **ccs811_params.h** is included.

## <a name="measurement_results"> Measurement results </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

Once the measurement mode is set, the user task can use function
#ccs811_read_iaq to fetch the results. The function returns **raw data**
as well as **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)** values. If some of the results
are not needed, the corresponding parameters can be set to `NULL`.

While raw data represents simply the current through the sensor and the
voltage across the sensor with the selected current, IAQ values are the
results of the processing of these raw data by the sensor. IAQ values consist
of the **equivalent CO2 (eCO2)** with a range from 400 ppm to 8192 ppm
and **Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC)** with a range from 0 ppb
to 1187 ppb.

```
uint16_t iaq_tvoc;
uint16_t iaq_eco2;
uint16_t raw_i;
uint16_t raw_v;
...
/* get the results and do something with them */
if (ccs811_read_iaq (&sensor, &tvoc, &eco2, &raw_i, &raw_v) == CCS811_OK) {
    ...
}
else {
    ... /* error handling */
}
...
```

If the #ccs811_read_iaq function is called and no new data are
available, the function returns the results of the last valid
measurement and error code #CCS811_ERROR_NO_NEW_DATA.

There are two approaches to wait until new data are available:

- data-ready interrupt (#CCS811_INT_DATA_READY)
- data-ready status function (#ccs811_data_ready)

```
uint16_t iaq_tvoc;
uint16_t iaq_eco2;
uint16_t raw_i;
uint16_t raw_v;
...
/* check whether new data are available, get the data and do something with them */
if (ccs811_data_ready (&sensor) == CCS811_OK &&
    ccs811_read_iaq (&sensor, &tvoc, &eco2, &raw_i, &raw_v) == CCS811_OK)
{
    ...
}
...
```
When using data-ready interrupts, the default configuration parameter for
the interrupt pin can be overridden by defining **CCS811_PARAM_INT_PIN**
before **ccs811_params.h** is included.

## <a name="compensation"> Compensation </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

If information about the environment like temperature and humidity are
available from another sensor, they can be used by CCS811 to compensate
gas readings due to temperature and humidity changes.

@note This feature can only be used with the `ccs811_full` module.

Function #ccs811_set_environmental_data can be used to set these environmental
data. In the following example, the Sensirion SHT3x humidity and
temperature sensor is used to fetch environmental data.

```
int16_t  temperature;   /* in hundredths of a degree Celsius */
int16_t  humidity;      /* in hundredths of a percent */
...
if (sht3x_get_results (sht3x, &temperature, &humidity))
    /* set CCS811 environmental data with values fetched from SHT3x */
    ccs811_set_environmental_data (ccs811, temperature, humidity);
...
```

## <a name="ntc"> Negative Thermal Coefficient Thermistor (NTC) </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

CCS811 supports an external interface for connecting a negative thermal
coefficient thermistor (R_NTC) to provide a cost effective and power
efficient means of calculating the local ambient temperature.

@note This feature can only be used with the `ccs811_full` module.

The sensor measures the voltage V_NTC across R_NTC as well as the voltage V_REF
across a connected reference resistor (R_REF). Function #ccs811_read_ntc
can be used at any time to fetch the current resistance of R_NTC. It
uses the resistance of R_REF and measured voltages V_REF and V_NTV with
the following equation to determine R_NTC:

```
R_NTC = R_REF / V_REF * V_NTC
```

Using the data sheet of the NTC, the ambient temperature can be
calculated. See application note AMS AN000372 for more details.
For example, with
[Adafruit CCS811 Air Quality Sensor Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3566)
the ambient temperature can be determined as following:

```
...
#define CCS811_R_REF       100000 /* resistance of the reference resistor */
#define CCS811_R_NTC       10000  /* resistance of NTC at a reference temperature */
#define CCS811_R_NTC_TEMP  25     /* reference temperature for NTC */
#define CCS811_BCONSTANT   3380   /* B constant */

/* get NTC resistance */
uint32_t r_ntc;
ccs811_read_ntc (&sensor, CCS811_R_REF, &r_ntc);

/* calculation of temperature from application note ams AN000372 */
double ntc_temp;
ntc_temp  = log((double)r_ntc / CCS811_R_NTC);      /* 1 */
ntc_temp /= CCS811_BCONSTANT;                       /* 2 */
ntc_temp += 1.0 / (CCS811_R_NTC_TEMP + 273.15);     /* 3 */
ntc_temp  = 1.0 / ntc_temp;                         /* 4 */
ntc_temp -= 273.15;                                 /* 5 */
....
```

## <a name="interrupts"> Interrupts </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

CCS811 supports two types of interrupts that can be used to fetch data:

- data ready interrupt (#CCS811_INT_DATA_READY)
- threshold interrupt (#CCS811_INT_THRESHOLD)

@note
- Interrupts can only be used with the `ccs811_full` module.
- It is not possible to use both interrupts at the same time.

### <a name="data_ready_interrupt"> Data ready interrupt </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

At the end of each measurement cycle (every 250 ms, 1 second, 10 seconds,
or 60 seconds), CCS811 can optionally trigger an interrupt. The signal
**nINT** is driven low as soon as new sensor values are ready to read.
It will stop being driven low when sensor data are read with function
#ccs811_read_iaq.

The interrupt is disabled by default. It can be enabled using function
#ccs811_set_int_mode.

```
...
/* enable the data ready interrupt */
ccs811_set_int_mode (&sensor, CCS811_INT_DATA_READY);
...
```

### <a name="threshold interrupt"> Threshold interrupt </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

The user task can choose that the data ready interrupt is not generated
every time when new sensor values become ready but only if the eCO2 value
moves from the current range (LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH) into another range by
more than a hysteresis value. Hysteresis is used to prevent multiple
interrupts close to a threshold.

The interrupt is disabled by default and can be enabled with function
#ccs811_set_int_mode. The ranges are defined by the
#ccs811_set_eco2_thresholds function and its parameters \p low and \p high
as following:

Name   | Range                                     | Value  | Default
:------|:------------------------------------------|:-------|:-------
LOW    | below the \p low parameter                | > 400  | 1500
MEDIUM | between the \p low and \p high parameters |        | |
HIGH   | above the value of the \p high parameter  | < 8192 | 2500

```
...
/* set threshold parameters and enable threshold interrupt mode */
ccs811_set_eco2_thresholds (&sensor, 600, 1100, 40);
ccs811_set_int_mode (&sensor, CCS811_INT_THRESHOLD);
...
```

## <a name="power saving"> Power Saving </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

The CCS811 offers a **sleep mode** with **wake-up** function. By using the
active low **nWAKE** signal connected to a GPIO, power can be saved. If the
**nWAKE** signal is low, the CCS811 is active and can communicate over
I2C. When this signal is high, the CCS811 goes into sleep mode and can't
be reached via I2C. The measuring process is not affected.

The driver supports this feature when the **nWAKE** signal pin
(#ccs811_params_t::wake_pin) is configured, see the
[Configuration](#Configuration) section.

@note If the **nWAKE** signal pin is not used, it must be permanently pulled
down. Sleep mode/wake-up feature can not be used in this case.

Additionally, CCS811 can be disabled with the #ccs811_power_down function
function, when no measurements are required. For that purpose, the sensor is
switched to the idle, low current mode (#CCS811_MODE_IDLE).
To reactivate the CCS811 in the previous measurement mode, the
#ccs811_power_up function has to be used.

@note It may take several minutes before accurate readings are
generated when the sensor switches back from idle mode to the
previous measurement mode.
Therefore, the best power-saving solution is to leave the sensor in any
measurement mode and to use it with data-ready interrupt
(#CCS811_INT_DATA_READY) in conjunction with the **nWAKE** signal pin.

## <a name="baseline"> Baseline </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

CCS81 supports automatic baseline correction over a minimum time of
24 hours. Using function #ccs811_get_baseline, the current baseline
value can be saved before the sensor is powered down. This baseline
can then be restored with function #ccs811_set_baseline after sensor
is powered up again to continue the automatic baseline process.

@note This feature can only be used with the `ccs811_full` module.

## <a name="error_handling"> Error Handling </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

All driver functions return an error code (#ccs811_error_codes_t) to
indicate whether its execution was successful or an error happened.

## <a name="configuration"> Configuration </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

### <a name="hardware_configuration"> Hardware Configurations </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

The following figure shows the most simple hardware configuration with CCS811.
With this configuration interrupts, the hardware reset, and the sleep
mode of the sensor with wake-up feature can't be used. The signals
**nINT** and **nRESET** are not connected. The **nWAKE** signal is
permanently pulled low, leaving the CCS811 and I2C constantly active.

```
  +--------+       +--------+
  | MCU    |       | CCS811 |
  |        |       |        |
  |    SCL >-------> SCL    |
  |    SDA <-------> SDA    |
  |    GND --------> /WAKE  |
  +--------+       +--------+
```
If the interrupt signal **nINT** is used to fetch new data
(only with `ccs811_full` module),
the interrupt pin has to be connected to a GPIO pin.

```
  +--------+       +--------+
  | MCU    |       | CCS811 |
  |        |       |        |
  |    SCL >-------> SCL    |
  |    SDA <-------> SDA    |
  |   GPIO <-------> /INT   |
  |    GND --------> /WAKE  |
  +--------+       +--------+
```

To use the hardware reset and/or the sleep mode with wake-up feature,
additional GPIOs have to be used. This is the most energy-efficient
hardware configuration of the sensor but requires more GPIO pins.
Used GPIOs must be configured accordingly in driver [configuration
parameters](#ccs811_driver_configuration).

```
  +--------+       +--------+
  | MCU    |       | CCS811 |
  |        |       |        |
  |    SCL >-------> SCL    |
  |    SDA <-------> SDA    |
  |  GPIOx <-------> /INT   |
  |  GPIOy --------> /WAKE  |
  |  GPIOz --------> /RESET |
  +--------+       +--------+
```

If CCS811 sensor is used in conjunction with another sensor, e.g.,
a SHT3x sensor, the hardware configuration looks like following:

```
  +--------+       +--------+
  | MCU    |       | CCS811 |
  |        |       |        |
  |    SCL >--+----> SCL    |
  |    SDA <--|-+--> SDA    |
  |    GND ---|-|--> /WAKE  |
  |        |  | |  +--------+
  |        |  | |  | SHT3x  |
  |        |  | |  |        |
  |        |  +----> SCL    |
  |        |    +--> SDA    |
  +--------+       +--------+
```

### <a name="driver_configuration"> Driver Configuration Parameters </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; [[TOC](#toc)]

The following configuration parameters can be used to configure the
sensor during its initialization (#ccs811_init):

Parameter         | Member                     | Define macro           | Default
----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------
I2C device        | ccs811_params_t::i2c_dev   | CCS811_PARAM_I2C_DEV   | #I2C_DEV(0)
I2C slave address | ccs811_params_t::i2c_addr  | CCS811_PARAM_I2C_ADDR  | #CCS811_I2C_ADDRESS_1
Measurement mode  | ccs811_params_t::mode      | CCS811_PARAM_MODE      | #CCS811_MODE_1S
Interrupt mode    | ccs811_params_t::int_mode  | CCS811_PARAM_INT_MODE  | #CCS811_INT_NONE
Interrupt pin     | ccs811_params_t::int_pin   | CCS811_PARAM_INT_PIN   | #GPIO_PIN(0, 0)
Wake-up pin       | ccs811_params_t::wake_pin  | CCS811_PARAM_WAKE_PIN  | #GPIO_UNDEF
Reset pin         | ccs811_params_t::reset_pin | CCS811_PARAM_RESET_PIN | #GPIO_UNDEF

The default configuration of these parameters can be overridden by
defining according macros before including **ccs811_params.h**, for example:
```
#define CCS811_PARAM_I2C_DEV     (I2C_DEV(1))
#define CCS811_PARAM_I2C_ADDR    (CCS811_I2C_ADDRESS_2)
#define CCS811_PARAM_MODE        (CCS811_MODE_10S)
#define CCS811_PARAM_RESET_PIN   (GPIO_PIN(0, 0))
#define CCS811_PARAM_WAKE_PIN    (GPIO_PIN(0, 1))
#define CCS811_PARAM_INT_PIN     (GPIO_PIN(0, 2))
#define CCS811_PARAM_INT_MODE    (CCS811_INT_DATA_READY)
...
#include "ccs811.h"
#include "ccs811_params.h"
```

Alternatively, the complete set of default configuration parameters could
also be overridden by a single definition, for example:
```
#define CCS811_PARAMS    { .i2c_dev   = I2C, \
                           .i2c_addr  = CCS811_I2C_ADDRESS_2, \
                           .mode      = CCS811_MODE_10S, \
                           .reset_pin = GPIO_PIN(0, 0), \
                           .wake_pin  = GPIO_PIN(0, 1), \
                           .int_pin   = GPIO_PIN(0, 2), \
                           .int_mode  = CCS811_INT_DATA_READY, \
                         }
```
*/
