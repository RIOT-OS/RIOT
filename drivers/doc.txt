 *
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * The driver is enabled by using the module `shield_w5100`, e.g. with:
 *
 * ```
 * USEMODULE=shield_w5100 make BOARD=arduino-due -C examples/networking/gnrc_networking/gnrc_networking
 * ```
 *
 * It depends on @ref drivers_w5100 and provides nothing more than the providing
 * the correct configuration. For this, it depends on the `arduino_pins`,
 * `arduino_spi`, `arduino_shield_uno` and the `arduino_shield_isp` feature.
 * It should work out of the box for any fully Arduino UNO compatible board
 * (including the ISP header) and correct I/O mapping (`arduino_*`) features.
