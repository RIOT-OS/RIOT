 * https://manualzz.com/doc/55353537/semtech-sx1280-2.4-ghz-transceiver-datasheet
 *
 * When subjected to a high co-channel traffic conditions
 * (for example in BLE mode when the SX1280 receives more than 220 packets per second)
 * and only when configured in continuous receiver
 * The SX1280 busy line will remain high and the radio unresponsive.
 *
 * If the radio may be subject to high levels of BLE traffic, to allow the radio to remain in operation RX single mode must be used
