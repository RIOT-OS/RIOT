        ALS lux resolution is used to convert count values from ambient
        light sensing to lux values. It is specified as lux/count*1000.
        The factory calibrated lux resolution is 0.32 lux/count.

    help
        The measurement period is defined as multiple of 10 ms. It is used for
        both range measurements and ambient light sensing (ALS) in
        continuous mode.
        The measurement period also controls the measurement mode used after
        sensor initialization. If the measurement period is 0, the single-shot
        mode is used for both the range and ALS measurements, and functions
        vl6180x_rng_start_single and vl6180x_als_start_single have to be used
        to start a single measurement. Otherwise the continuous mode is
        used for both measurements which are started immediatly after sensor
        initialization.
