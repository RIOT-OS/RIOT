 * @brief       Peripheral extensions for intercepting API calls and redirecting
 *              to non-peripheral drivers
 *
 * The extension interface makes handling of non-CPU devices invisible to code
 * using the periph APIs (periph/*.h). This is accomplished by reserving part of
 * the range of values of that API's identifier. When a call to the periph API
 * uses an identifier that falls within this range, it is parsed into a device
 * ID that is looked up in an extension list and the call is redirected to the
 * corresponding device.
