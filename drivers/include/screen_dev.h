 * @ingroup     drivers_display
 * @brief       Define the generic API of a screen device
 *
 * The screen device API is a generic API built on top of display and touch
 * device APIs.
 *
 * Each display/touch device driver implementing this interface has to expose
 * a set of predefined functions and it has to register itself to the central
 * display/touch device registry. From here devices can be found, listed, and
 * accessed.
 *
 * The display and touch devices are linked to a screen by providing the
 * screen id (basically an index) they correspond to.
 *
 * @see drivers_disp_dev @see drivers_touch_dev
 *
 * @experimental This API is experimental and in an early state - expect
 *               changes!
