 * @brief Initialize a servo motor by assigning it a PWM device and channel
 *
 * Digital servos are controlled by regular pulses sent to them. The width
 * of a pulse determines the position of the servo. A pulse width of 1.5ms
 * puts the servo in the center position, a pulse width of about 1.0ms and
 * about 2.0ms put the servo to the maximum angles. These values can however
 * differ slightly from servo to servo, so the min and max values are
 * parameterized in the init function.
 *
 * The servo is initialized with fixed PWM values:
 * - frequency: 100Hz (10ms interval)
 * - resolution: 10000 (1000 steps per ms)
 *
 * Caution: When initializing a servo, the PWM device will be reconfigured to
 * new frequency/resolution values. It is however fine to use multiple servos
 * with the same PWM device, just on different channels.
