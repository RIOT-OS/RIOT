 * @brief       BLE adaption of netdev
 * @{
 *
 * @warning     This API is experimental and in an early state - expect
 *              significant changes!
 *
 * # About
 *
 * BLE defines a very specific environment for the used radio, both in terms of
 * communication sequences and in terms of timings. BLE communication is
 * structured in so called events, where each event is a sequence of request and
 * reply packets send between two peers. A radio context (frequency, CRC
 * initializer, and access address) is used throughout such an event and
 * typically changed for the next one. In addition, the timing of the packets
 * sent in a sequence is fixed to an inter-frame-spacing of exactly 150us.
 *
 * To cater with these specific attributes of BLE, this interface tailors the
 * generic netdev interface to be used for BLE radios.
 *
 *
 * # Interface Adaption / Netdev Interpretation
 *
 * ## Transmission Sequence Based Approach
 *
 * To be able to handle the exact inter-packet-spacing if 150us seconds, this
 * interface expects the device driver to stay in a continuous alternating
 * RX-TX sequence, until it is manually aborted. While in this sequence, the
 * radio driver needs to take care of switching to RX mode 150us after sending
 * the last packet, and to send the next packet 150us after the last packet was
 * received.
 *
 * Such a transmission sequence is started by calling either the radio's send
 * or receive function while the radio is in idle/standby mode.
 *
 * Once a transmission sequence is in progress, the next packet to be send, or
 * the next reception buffer to be used is specified also using the send/recv
 * functions. They should be called in the `event_callback` right after the
 * last transmission (RX or TX) was finished.
 *
 * The transmission sequence is aborted by calling `netdev_ble_stop(dev)`
 * (`netdev->set(dev, NETOPT_BLE_CTX, NULL, 0)`). This will put the radio back
 * into idle/standby mode.
 *
 * ## Radio Context
 *
 * As BLE uses time sliced channel hopping, the used channel needs to be set
 * regularly. Additionally, also the used access address and the CRC initializer
 * need to be set regularly, as they differ for different BLE connections. To
 * make setting these values more efficient, this interface combines these three
 * values in to a so called `radio context` and adds a `netopt` option to set
 * all three values at once using `netdev_ble_set_ctx(dev, ctx)`
 * (`netdev->set(dev, NETOPT_BLE_CTX, ctx, sizeof(netdev_ble_ctx_t))`).
 *
 *
 * # Implementation Status and Limitations
 * - This interface works for memory mapped radios only (no support for
 *   bus-connected devices). This is mainly for timing reasons.
 * - No support for LE Data Length Extension (bigger packet size), yet
