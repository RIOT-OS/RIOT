 * @{
 * @brief       Low level Memory Technology Device interface
 *
 * Generic memory technology device interface
 *
 * Unlike the @ref drivers_periph_flashpage, this is device driver based (i.e.
 * all functions take a @ref mtd_dev_t as a first argument), so that SPI based
 * EEPROMs (e.g. @ref drivers_mtd_at25xxx "AT25xxx") can be accessed the same
 * way as @ref drivers_mtd_flashpage "internal flash" or @ref
 * drivers_mtd_sdcard "SD cards"), all inside the same application.
 *
 * MTD devices expose a block based erase and write interface. In that, they
 * are the distinct from block devices (like hard disks) on which individual
 * bytes can be overwritten. The [Linux MTD FAQ](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/general.html)
 * has a convenient comparison (beware though of terminology differences
 * outlined below). They can be erased (with some granularity, often wearing
 * out the erased area a bit), and erased areas can be written to (sometimes
 * multiple times).
 *
 * MTD devices are described in terms of sectors, pages and feature flags:
 *
 * * A **sector** is the device's erase unit. Calls to @ref mtd_erase need to
 *   work in alignment with this number (commonly somewhere around 1kiB).
 *
 *   (Note that this corresponds to the term "page" as used in the flashpage
 *   API, and the term "eraseblock" in Linux's MTD).
 *
 * * A **page** is the largest a device can write in one transfer.
 *
 *   Applications rarely need to deal with this; it offers no guarantees on
 *   atomicity, but writing within a page is generally faster than across page
 *   boundaries.
 *
 *   Pages are a subdivision of sectors.
 *
 * * The **write size** is the minimum size of writes to the device, and also
 *   the required alignment of writes.
 *
 *   The write size is a divider of the page. It is often between 1 to 4 bytes
 *   long, but may be up to the full page size.
 *
 * * The device's **flags** indicate features, eg. whether a memory location
 *   can be overwritten without erasing it first.
 *
 * Unless a flag (such as @ref MTD_DRIVER_FLAG_DIRECT_WRITE or @ref
 * MTD_DRIVER_FLAG_CLEARING_OVERWRITE) allows it, this MTD API does not allow
 * memory areas to be written to twice between erase operations. Drivers are
 * not expected to count write accesses, and neither do this module's
 * functions: The performance impact would be too great. It is up to the
 * application to only write to erased memory once. Failure to do so may damage
 * hardware.
 *
 * This MTD API currently does not specify which value will be read from an
 * erased sector.
