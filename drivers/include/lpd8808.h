 * @brief       Driver for LPD8808 based LED strips
 *
 * LPD8808 based LED strips consist of a number of LEDs driven by LPD8808 chips.
 * In these strips, each LED can be controlled individually. For this, every two
 * LEDs are driven by a LPD8808 chip, which are chained and form a long shift
 * register. To control a certain LED, the target color value needs to be
 * shifted to the LEDs position on the strip.
 *
 * This driver implementation does not buffer the current values for each LED.
 * It expects the application to take care of this.
