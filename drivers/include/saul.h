 * @brief       Generic sensor/actuator abstraction layer for RIOT
 *
 * SAUL is a generic actuator/sensor interface in RIOT. Its purpose is to
 * enable unified interaction with a wide range of sensors and actuators through
 * a set of defined access functions and a common data structure.
 *
 * Each device driver implementing this interface has to expose a set of
 * predefined functions and it has to register itself to the central SAUL
 * registry. From here devices can be found, listed, and accessed.
 *
 * Each device has further to expose a name and its type. This information can
 * be used for automated searching and matching of devices (e.g. connect light
 * sensor automatically with the color of an RGB LED...).
 *
 * The SAUL module enables further the automated initialization of preconfigured
 * actuators/sensor via auto_init and the access to all available devices via
 * one unified shell command.
 *
 * @todo        So far, the interface only supports simple read and set
 *              operations. It probably needs to be extended to handling events,
 *              thresholds, and so on.

/**
 * @brief   Definition of device classes
 *
 * This list contains a collections of available device classes. Each device
 * must be part of one, but can be part of multiple of these classes. When
 * belonging to more than one class, a device must however expose one driver
 * for each class it belongs to, and it has to register each driver with a
 * separate entry at the SAUL registry.
 *
 * Classes are identified by 8-bit unsigned integers.
 *
 * For searching and filtering purposes, the device classes are further split
 * into two top-level classes: sensors and actuators. For identification, all
 * actuator classes start with 0b01xxxxxx, all sensor classes start with
 * 0b10xxxxxx.
 *
 * This list is not exhaustive, extend to your needs!
