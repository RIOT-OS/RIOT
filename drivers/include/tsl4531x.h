 * @brief       Device driver for the AMS TSL4531 sensor
 * @{
 *
 * # Power modes
 *
 * This driver has two power modes: high and low. Its startup mode is configured
 * in the initialization parameters, and it can also be changed during runtime.
 *
 * In high power mode, the user application can read from the device using the
 * tsl4531x_simple_read function, and it will return immediately.
 *
 * In low power mode, the user application can interact with the driver in a
 * synchronous or asynchronous manner. For synchronous operation, the application
 * can call tsl4531x_simple_read, and the driver will block for the integration
 * time defined in the initialization parameters (plus a small margin, to encompass
 * the max times indicated in the datasheet). For asynchronous operation, the
 * application needs to use the functions tsl4531x_start_sample,
 * tsl4531x_time_until_sample_ready and tsl4531x_get_sample, as described in those
 * functions' descriptions.
 *
 * Both modes will work through SAUL, with the low-power mode being synchronous.
