 * @brief       Device driver interface for the Sensirion SGP30 Gas Sensor
 *
 * About
 * =====
 *
 * This driver provides an interface for the Sensirion SGP30 Gas Sensor.
 * The Datasheet can be found [here](https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Sensirion_Gas_Sensors_SGP30_Datasheet_EN-1148053.pdf)
 *
 * After the sensor is powered up and starts measuring air quality for the
 * first 15s @ref sgp30_read_measurements calls will return fixed values of
 * of 400ppm CO2eq and 0ppb TVOC. Afterwards values should be read in regular
 * intervals of 1s for best operation of the dynamic baseline compensation
 * algorithm.
 *
 * The above is not done by default unless the `sgp30_strict` module is included.
 * In that case, if attempting to read before the is completed, then -EAGAIN
 * will be returned. After this periodic readings happen every 1s, and the last
 * value read is returned when calling @ref sgp30_read_measurements. A
 * timestamp is also added to @ref sgp30_data_t.
 *
 * The sensor features on-chip humidity compensation for the air quality
 * measurements. @ref sgp30_set_absolute_humidity can be used to change the
 * absolute humidity value used. See [SGP30 driver integration] (https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-VOC_and_eCO2_Gas_Sensor-SGP30/res/Sensirion_Gas_Sensors_SGP30_Driver-Integration-Guide_HW_I2C.pdf)
 * for more on this. The baseline values for the correction algorithm can
 * also be tweaked with @ref sgp30_set_baseline. More on how to implement
 * dynamic baseline compensation can be seen at [SGP30 driver integration] (https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-VOC_and_eCO2_Gas_Sensor-SGP30/res/Sensirion_Gas_Sensors_SGP30_Driver-Integration-Guide_HW_I2C.pdf).
