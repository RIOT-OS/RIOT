 * @brief       Use a DAC to play a buffer of samples
 *
 *              A buffer of (audio) samples can be played on a DAC with
 *              a given sample rate.
 *              To supply a steady stream of samples, a double buffer is
 *              used.
 *              While buffer A is played on the DAC the user can fill buffer
 *              B with the next batch of samples by calling @ref dac_dds_play
 *              again. Once buffer A has finished playing, buffer B will
 *              automatically be used instead.
 *
 *              A callback can be registered that signals when the next buffer
 *              is ready to be filled.
 *              Do not do the actual buffer filling inside the callback as this
 *              is called from the timer context that is used to play the samples.
 *              Instead, use it to wake a thread that then provides the samples
 *              and calls @ref dac_dds_play.
 *              If the next sample buffer is already prepared, you can also call
 *              `dac_dds_play` within the callback, just don't do any I/O or
 *              heavy processing.
