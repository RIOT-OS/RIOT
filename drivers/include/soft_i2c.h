 * @brief       Software implemented I2C
 *
 * This module provides a software implemented I2C bus. It depends on the
 * @ref drivers_periph_gpio_ll and either uses open drain (if available) or
 * `gpio_ll_switch_dir` feature when not.
 *
 * It enabled the integrated pull ups on both SCL and SDA, if available.
 * External pull ups are generally recommended, for MCUs that do not support
 * internal pulls ups, they are mandatory.
