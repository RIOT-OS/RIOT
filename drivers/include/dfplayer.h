 * @brief       Driver for the DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player
 *
 * The DFPlayer Mini is a super cheap MP3 Player that can be controlled via
 * UART. It can play files from SD card, USB storage devices and NOR flash.
 * It has an integrated 3W amplifier that can be used to build a standalone
 * mono speaker. Alternatively a stereo output can be used that can be
 * directly connected to headphones, but needs a dedicated amplifier for
 * connecting to passive speakers.
 *

 *
 * File System Setup
 * =================
 *
 * The SD card or USB storage devices needs to be formatted as FAT32 and the
 * MP3 files have to be stored using one of the following naming schemes, if
 * selecting the files efficiently is required:
 *
 * Numbered File Inside Numbered Folder Naming Scheme
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The MP3 files have to be named with three leading decimal digits (e.g.
 * `001.mp3` or `042 - foo bar.mp3`) and must be placed in in folders named with
 * two decimal digits (e.g. `01` or `99`). The folder name numbers must be in
 * the range 1-99 and the file name numbers in the range 1-255. Playback of
 * these files can be started using the function @ref dfplayer_play_file .
 *
 * Examples of valid paths:
 *
 * - `01/001.mp3`
 * - `19/249 - Nothing Else Matters.mp3`
 *
 * Examples of ***INVALID*** paths:
 *
 * - `01 - Yngwie Malmsteen/042 - Leonardo.mp3`
 *     - The folder name must only consist of two digits, additional chars are
 *       not allowed in the folder name
 * - `9/42.mp3`
 *     - Leading zeros must be added, e.g. `09/042.mp3` would be valid
 * - `99/359.mp3`
 *     - Folder number out of range (1-255 is valid)
 *
 * Numbered File Inside MP3 Folder Naming Scheme
 * ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * The MP3 files have to be named with four decimal digits and must be placed in
 * the folder `"MP3"`. Subsequent characters after the four digits are ignored.
 * Valid names are e.g. `MP3/0001.mp3` or `MP3/0042 - My favorite song.mp3`. The
 * file numbers 1-9999 are valid. Playback of these files can be started using
 * the function @ref dfplayer_play_from_mp3 .
 *
 * Advertisements
 * --------------
 *
 * MP3 files placed in the folder `"ADVERT"` named with four decimal digits
 * (e.g. `"0001.mp3"` or `"1337.mp3"`) can be played as advertisements: The
 * function @ref dfplayer_play_from_advert can be used to start their playback,
 * but only while a non-advertisement is currently playing. After the
 * advertisement the normal playback is resumed. This feature has been
 * implemented in the hope it is used for features like audible user feedback
 * to controls, rather than playing advertisements.
 *
 * Combining Naming Schemes
 * ------------------------
 *
 * All of the above naming schemes can be used on the same storage device.
 * However, you still have to use to the functions intended to be used with
 * the naming scheme of a specific file in order to be able to play it.
 *
 * Track Numbers
 * =============
 *
 * @warning     Track numbers are a bogus unit in the DFPlayer
 *
 * Track numbers in the dfplayer revert to the number of the file in the file
 * system. Without preparing the medium played at a very low level, it will be
 * hard to map track numbers to their corresponding songs. If you started
 * playback using @ref dfplayer_play_file or @ref dfplayer_play_from_mp3, you
 * can use @ref dfplayer_get_played_file to get the currently played filed
 * according to the used naming scheme (see section above).
 *
 * Continuous Playback
 * ===================
 *
 * The are two options for achieving continuous playback with the DFPlayer Mini:
 * The first is to use @ref dfplayer_shuffle_all or @ref dfplayer_repeat_folder
 * to schedule shuffled playback of all files or repeat playback of a folder,
 * respectively. But keep in mind that any playback command will switch back to
 * normal playback mode.
 *
 * The second option is to schedule playback of the next file right after the
 * playback of a file has completed. This can be implemented most conveniently
 * by using the callback functions (see @ref dfplayer_set_callbacks). But
 * beware: The callbacks are called in interrupt context and the API of this
 * driver ***MUST ONLY*** be used in thread context.
 *
 * Known Hardware Bugs
 * ===================
 *
 * Device Bugs Not Handled by the Driver
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 * On some versions of the DFPlayer, any UART communication with the device
 * during playback results in audible and unpleasant glitches. The only solution
 * is to not communicate with the device during playback, as the DFPlayer seems
 * to pause playback for some milliseconds after receiving a command. If the
 * busy pin of the DFPlayer is connected to your board and configured, the
 * function @ref dfplayer_get_state will read the busy pin to detect if the
 * DFPlayer is currently playing. Onlyif according to the busy pin the device is
 * not currently playing, the UART interface is used to detect whether the
 * playback is paused or stopped. Thus, @ref dfplayer_get_state can be used
 * without fearing to cause audio glitches, provided the busy pin is connected
 * and configured. You can use this to poll the state of the DPlayer and issue
 * the commands once playback has completed, or use the callbacks (see
 * @ref dfplayer_set_callbacks) to get notified when playback has completed.
 *
 * When playback of a file from the `"ADVERT"` folder is started while the
 * device not playing, or already playing a file from the `"ADVERT"` folder,
 * the command fails to execute and the DFPlayer stops all playback (if
 * currently playing).
 *
 * Device Bugs Handled by the Driver
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * (These bugs are transparently handled by the driver, so users of the driver
 * can safely skip reading this section.)
 *
 * When playing a file from the MP3 folder or from the ADVERT folder, the
 * DFPlayer acknowledges the command before checking if the file actually
 * exists. If the file does not exist, a second message to indicate the failure
 * is send, but no second message is send on success. If the second message is
 * not received, the driver has to figure out by other means if this is a
 * communication error or indicates that the playback has started. If the
 * busy pin of the DFPlayer is connected and configured, it will be used to
 * verify that the command succeeded. Otherwise, the driver will query the
 * status of the device via UART to confirm that playback started, which can
 * cause audible glitches on some revisions. For those revisions, the busy pin
 * should be really used.
 *
 * When the DFPlayer completes playback of a file, the next command received
 * is not acknowledged, if it is a control command. Query commands are not
 * affected. The driver works around this bug by querying the volume prior to
 * issuing a control command directly after playback completed.
 *
 * Some versions of the DFPlayer are not able to handle commands send at high
 * frequency. A delay of 100ms is inserted after every communication with the
 * device to counter this.
 *
 * Some versions of the DFPlayer have a high chance of ignoring commands. The
 * driver tries up to @ref DFPLAYER_RETRIES (`5` be default) times the command
 * before giving up. For that reason, non-idempotent commands supported by the
 * DFPlayer (e.g. increase and decrease volume) are not exposed by the driver,
 * as retrying could result in them being executed more than once. There are
 * idempotent commands that can achieve the same (e.g. the set volume command
 * instead of increase or decrease volume commands) for every non-idempotent
 * command, so this doesn't restrict the feature set of the driver.
