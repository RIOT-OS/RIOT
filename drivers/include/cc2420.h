---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|        |         |          |         |         |            |          |
| Length |   FCF   |  Seq No. |Address  | PhySrc  |    Data    |    FCS   |
|        |         |          |         |         |            |          |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 byte    2 bytes     1 byte  2/8 bytes  2/8 bytes  <=118 bytes  2 bytes

A 5 byte SHR will be generated and added in hardware.
SHR contains a preable sequence and a start of delimiter,

Length does not contain SHR and Length,
first bit of length has to be 0 (length has only 7bit)

Address fields can be in total between 4 and 20 bytes
FCS contain a hardware generated CRC sum with the polynom x^16+x^12+x^5+1
When receiving a package FCS will be checked by hardware, the first FCS byte will be replaced by RSSI,
followed by a CRC OK bit and the unsigned 7 bit correlation value.
FCF:
		Bit | Meaning
		--------------------
		0-2	| Frame Type
		  3 | Security Enabled
		  4 | Frame Pending
		  5 | Acknowledge request
		  6 | PAN ID Compression Field
		7-9 | Reserved
	  10-11 | Destination addressing mode
	  12-13 | Reserved
	  14-15 | Source addressing mode

For the cc2420 bit 0 is the most right bit and bit 15 is the most left bit.
But the 2 FCF bytes have to be transmitted littel endian (byte 15 to 8 first than 7 to 0)

Addressing mode value:

       Bit | Meaning
       ---------------------
        00 | PAN identifier and address field are not present.
        01 | Reserved.
        10 | Address field contains a 16 bit short address.
        11 | Address field contains a 64 bit extended address.

Frame type value:

       Bit | Meaning
       ---------------------
       000 | Beacon
       001 | Data
       010 | Acknowledgment
       011 | MAC command
       1xx | Reserved
