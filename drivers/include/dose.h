 * @ingroup     drivers_netdev
 * @brief       Driver for connecting RIOT devices using a single bus wire
 *
 * About
 * =====
 *
 * This driver enables RIOT nodes to communicate by Ethernet over a serial bus.
 * This enables them to interact in an easy and cheap manner using a single
 * bus wire with very low hardware requirements: The used microcontrollers just
 * need to feature at least one UART and one optional GPIO that is able to raise
 * interrupts.
 *
 * Wiring
 * ======
 *
 * ![DOSE wiring](dose-wiring.svg)
 *
 * For bus access, you need a CAN transceiver, since the DOSE uses the PHY layer
 * of CAN for the electrical connection of the nodes. Every transceiver IC
 * operating with the right voltage levels should do. (If you are on a 3.3V MCU,
 * you could use an IC such as the SN65HVD233.)
 *
 * Basically, UART TX and RX are connected to respective pins of the
 * transceiver. In addition, the RX pin can also be connected to the sense GPIO
 * if the UART does not implement the `periph_uart_rxstart_irq` feature.
 * In this case, the bus allocation can be detected more precisely and
 * collisions are less likely.
 *
 * How it works
 * ============
 *
 * Some technical details for those interested: The Ethernet frames are sent
 * onto the bus using `uart_write()` while observing the received echo from
 * the bus. This way collisions are detected (received echo != transmitted
 * octet) and retransmissions are scheduled. The frames are appended with a
 * CRC16 to protect the system from transmission errors.
 *
 * A note on high data rates
 * =========================
 *
 * When using high UART data rates (1 MBit/s and above) per-byte overhead
 * becomes significant.
 * A major factor here is setting (software) timers which are used to catch
 * error conditions.
 * To speed up the TX path it is therefore recommended to implement hardware
 * collision detection (if available) to avoid the need for setting a timeout
 * for each byte transmitted.
 *
 * To speed up the more critical RX path, enable the `dose_watchdog` module.
 * This requires a dedicated hardware timer `DOSE_TIMER_DEV` to be configured
 * in e.g. `board.h`.
 * The timer is shared between all DOSE interfaces and will periodically check
 * if any interface does not make progress with receiving a frame (payload
 * marker did not advance between two timer periods) and abort the RX process.
