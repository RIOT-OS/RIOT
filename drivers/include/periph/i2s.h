 * # About
 *
 * # Bus format and terminology
 *
 * I2S terminology is sometimes a bit vague. The bus format as specified by
 * Philips consists of at least:
 *
 * - Bit clock line, often indicated as BCLK, but SCK is also possible. Supplies
 *   the clock for the synchronous bit data, similar to the clock line in SPI.
 * - Word clock line. Officially "word select", or WS. Often indicated as LRCLK
 *   (left-right clock), but FS (frame sync) is also possible. Indicates to
 *   which channel the current word belongs. Low means left channel, high is
 *   right channel.
 * - At least one Data line. Often indicated with SDI/SDO (Serial Data In/Out),
 *   but variants are possible.
 *
 * Optionally:
 *
 * - Master clock line, usually 256 times the word clock frequency, used to
 *   drive internal operations in the DAC/ADC. Not included in the spec, but
 *   often included by peripherals.
 *
 * # Details
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * I2S requires a mix between compile-time configuration and runtime
 * reconfiguration. The compile-time configuration consists mostly of gpio
 * configuration.
 *
 * At runtime a number of settings must be reconfigurable to facilitate the
 * necessary flexibility of the interface.
 *
 * - Mode, switch between the MCU and the attached device providing the clocks.
 * - Direction, to switch between receiving and transmitting audio.
 * - Frame clock frequency to switch between different audio sample rates.
 * - Word size, e.g. switch between 16 bit and 24 bit samples.
 * - Number of words in a frame, to switch between single channel, stereo or arbitrary number of
 *   channels.
 * - Transaction buffer sizes, configure the size of the buffers that are going to be provided.
 *
 * ## Sample transactions
 *
 * The I2S peripheral API must be able to continuously transfer audio samples to
 * the device. The continuous stream of samples can be separated into
 * transactions. A transaction is a single continuous set of samples in memory,
 * fully described by a pointer and a length in bytes.
 * The continuous data transfer nature of the bus makes it suitable
 * for DMA operations, though the end user should not have to care about this.
 * DMA transfers allow the CPU to sleep or process other threads during the
 * full transactions. If DMA is not available the CPU must wake up twice to four
 * times every sample rate period to handle both channels in and out. With DMA
 * this can be reduced to once every transaction
 *
 * Sample transactions must be at least double buffered, adding a transaction
 * while the current transaction is on-going appends the new transaction to the
 * current on-going transaction. The appended transaction will automatically be
 * started after the current transaction to ensure continuous data transfers.
 *
 * Sample reception is identical to sample transmission. A transaction indicates
 * the memory space where to write the received samples to.
 *
 * ### Memory organization
 *
 * The organization of the transaction memory must be suitable for consumption
 * by the I2S peripherals. All words here are assumed to be at native endianness.
 *
 * 8 bit data must be organized as:
 *
 * ```
 * 32                          0
 * +------+------+------+------+
 * | L0   | R0   | L1   | R1   |
 * +------+------+------+------+
 * | L2   | R2   | L3   | R3   |
 * +------+------+------+------+
 * | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |
 * +------+------+------+------+
 * | LN-1 | RN-1 | LN   | RN   |
 * +------+------+------+------+
 * ```
 *
 * 16 bit samples must be organized as:
 *
 * ```
 * 32                          0
 * +-------------+-------------+
 * | L0          | R0          |
 * +-------------+-------------+
 * | L1          | R1          |
 * +-------------+-------------+
 * | ...         | ...         |
 * +-------------+-------------+
 * | LN          | RN          |
 * +-------------+-------------+
 * ```
 *
 * 24 bit samples must be organized as:
 *
 * ```
 * 32                          0
 * +------+--------------------+
 * | L0                 | 0x00 |
 * +--------------------+------+
 * | R0                 | 0x00 |
 * +--------------------+------+
 * | ...                | 0x00 |
 * +--------------------+------+
 * | LN                 | 0x00 |
 * +--------------------+------+
 * | RN                 | 0x00 |
 * +------+--------------------+
 * ```
 *
 * 32 bit samples must be organized as:
 *
 * ```
 * 32                          0
 * +---------------------------+
 * | L0                        |
 * +---------------------------+
 * | R0                        |
 * +---------------------------+
 * | ...                       |
 * +---------------------------+
 * | LN                        |
 * +---------------------------+
 * | RN                        |
 * +---------------------------+
 * ```
 *
 * ## Frequency
 *
 * The sample rate of the audio produced by the I2S bus matches the frequency of
 * the word clock configured. From this clock both the bit clock and the
 * controller clock are derived. The bit clock is defined as twice the bits per
 * channel and the master clock frequency is defined as 256 times the frequency
 * of the word clock.
 *
 * It is not always possible to perfectly match the requested sample rate on a
 * device. When configuring a sample rate, the actual sample rate can be requested
 * from the device via @ref i2s_get_frame_clock.
 *
 * ## Direction
 *
 * Peripherals can be configured at least as transmit or receive. Some
 * peripherals also support bidirectional.
 *
 * Notably the stm32 SPI/I2S peripheral is unidirectional and can be configured to both receive and
 * transmit audio.
