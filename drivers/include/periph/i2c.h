 * @brief       Low-level I2C peripheral driver interface definition
 *
 * The I2C signal lines SDA/SCL need external pull-up resistors which connect
 * the lines to the positive voltage supply Vcc. The I2C driver implementation
 * should enable the pin's internal pull-up resistors. There are however some
 * use cases for which the internal pull resistors are not strong enough and the
 * I2C bus will show faulty behavior. This can for example happen when
 * connecting a logic analyzer which will raise the capacitance of the bus. In
 * this case you should make sure you connect external pull-up resistors to both
 * I2C bus lines.
 *
 * The minimum and maximum resistances are computed by:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 * R_{min} &=& \frac{V_{DD} - V_{OL(max)}} {I_{OL}}\\
 * R_{max} &=& \frac{t_r} {(0.8473 \cdot C_b)}
 * \f}<br>
 * where:<br>
 * \f$ V_{DD} =\f$ Supply voltage,
 * \f$ V_{OL(max)} =\f$ Low level voltage,
 * \f$ I_{OL} =\f$ Low level output current,
 * \f$ t_r =\f$ Signal rise time,
 * \f$ C_b =\f$ Bus capacitance <br>
 * <br>The pull-up resistors depend on the bus speed.
 * Some typical values are:<br>
 * Normal mode:       10k&Omega;<br>
 * Fast mode:          2k&Omega;<br>
 * Fast plus mode:     2k&Omega;
 *
 * For more details refer to section 7.1 in:<br>
 * http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf
 *
 * @note        The current version of this interface only supports the
                7-bit addressing mode.
