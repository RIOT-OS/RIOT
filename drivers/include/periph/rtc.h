 * @brief       Low-level RTC (Real Time Clock) peripheral driver
 *
 * @note
 * The values used for setting and getting the time/alarm should
 * conform to the `struct tm` specification.
 * Compare: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/time.h.html
 *
 * # (Low-) Power Implications
 *
 * After the RTC has been initialized (i.e. after calling rtc_init()), the RTC
 * should be powered on and running. The RTC can then be powered off manually
 * at a later point in time by calling the rtc_poweroff() function. When the RTC
 * is powered back on using the rtc_poweron() function, it **should**
 * transparently continue its previously configured operation.
 *
 * On many CPUs, certain power states might need to be blocked in rtc_init(), so
 * that it is ensured that the RTC will function properly while it is enabled.
