/**
 * @brief   Common peripheral initialization function
 *
 * This function should call all needed static initialization functions for
 * configured peripheral drivers like SPI or I2C. This function SHOULD be called
 * early in the boot process, e.g. before the actual kernel initialization is
 * started.
 *
 * @note    This function is called by the boot up code. Application developers
 *          do not need to care. Developers porting RIOT to a new MCU must make
 *          sure that this function is called during boot up early on.
