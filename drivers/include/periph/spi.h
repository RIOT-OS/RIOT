 * @brief       Low-level SPI peripheral driver
 *
 * This interface defines an abstraction for using a CPU's hardware SPI units.
 * The interface only supports SPI master mode.
 *
 * As SPI buses can have multiple devices connected to them they are to be
 * considered as shared resources. To reflect this, the SPI interface is based
 * on a transaction model. This requires that the bus needs to be acquired
 * before usage and released afterwards, using the `spi_acquire()` and the
 * `spi_release()` functions.
 *
 * This interface supports both software and hardware chip select lines. This is
 * reflected by the cpi_cs_t type, which overloads the gpio_t type with platform
 * specific values for defining platform dependent hardware chip select lines.
 *
 * Some devices have however very uncommon requirements on the usage and the
 * timings of their chip select line. For those cases this interface allows to
 * manage the chip select line manually from the user code (e.g. by calling
 * gpio_set/clear explicitly) while deactivating the SPI driver internal chip
 * select handling by passing @ref GPIO_UNDEF as CS parameter.
 *
 * In the time, when the SPI bus is not used, the SPI unit should be in
 * low-power mode to save energy.
 *
 * The SPI unit's initialization is split into 3 parts:
 * 1. `spi_init()` should be called once for each SPI unit defined by a board
 *    during system initialization.
 * 2. `spi_init_cs()` should be called during device driver initialization, as
 *    each chip select pin/line is used uniquely by a specific device, i.e. chip
 *    select lines are no shared resource.
 * 3. `spi_acquire()` needs to be called for each new transaction. This function
 *    configures the bus with specific parameters (clock, mode) for the duration
 *    of that transaction.
 *
 * # (Low-) Power Implications
 *
 * As SPI buses are shared peripherals and the interfaces implements a
 * transaction based paradigm, we leverage this for the SPI peripherals power
 * management. After calling spi_init(), the SPI peripheral **should** be
 * completely powered off (e.g. through peripheral clock gating). It **should**
 * subsequently only be powered on and enabled in between spi_acquire() and
 * spi_release() blocks.
 *
 * In case the SPI driver implementation puts the active thread to sleep during
 * data transfer (e.g. when using DMA), the implementation might need to block
 * certain power states during that time.
