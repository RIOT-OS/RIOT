 * @brief   Initialize a PWM device
 *
 * The PWM module is based on virtual PWM devices, which can have one or more
 * channels. The PWM devices can be configured to run with a given frequency and
 * resolution, which are always identical for the complete device, hence for
 * every channel on a device.
 *
 * The desired frequency and resolution may not be possible on a given device
 * when chosen too large. In this case the PWM driver will always keep the
 * resolution and decrease the frequency if needed. To verify the correct
 * settings compare the returned value which is the actually set frequency.
