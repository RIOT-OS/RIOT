 * @brief       Low-level PWM peripheral driver
 *
 * This interface enables access to CPU peripherals generating PWM signals. On
 * most platforms, this interface will be implemented based on hardware timers,
 * though some CPUs provide dedicated PWM peripherals.
 *
 * The characteristics of a PWM signal can be defined by three basic parameters,
 * namely the frequency, the duty cycle, and the operational mode. This
 * interface supports basic PWM generation in left-aligned, right-aligned, and
 * center mode. Additionally the interface supports the definition of the used
 * resolution, defining the granularity with which one can specify the duty
 * cycle. This brings more flexibility to the configuration of the frequency,
 * especially on systems with low system clocks.
 *
 * Typically, a single PWM device (e.g. hardware timer) supports PWM signal
 * generation on multiple pins in parallel. While the duty cycle is selectable
 * for each channel individually, the frequency and resolution are shared for
 * all channels.
 *
 * The mapping/configuration of PWM devices (timers) and the used pins has to be
 * done in the board configuration (the board's `periph_conf.h).
 *
 * When using the PWM interface, first thing you have to do is initialize the
 * PWM device with the targeted mode, frequency, and resolution settings. Once
 * the device is initialized, it will start the generation of PWM signals on all
 * configured pins immediately, with an initial duty cycle of `0`. Use the
 * pwm_set() function to change the duty cycle for a given channel. If you
 * want to disable the PWM generation again, simply call pwm_poweroff().
 *
 * ## (Low-)Power implications
 *
 * After initialization, the a PWM peripheral **should** be powered on and
 * active. When manually stopped using the pwm_poweroff() function, the PWM
 * generation **should** be stopped for all channels and the PWM peripheral
 * **should** be fully power off (e.g. through peripheral clock gating). Once
 * being re-enabled by calling the pwm_poweron() function, the PWM peripheral
 * **should** transparently continue its previously configured operation,
 * including the last active duty cycle values.
 *
 * While a PWM device is active, some implementations might need to block
 * certain power modes.
