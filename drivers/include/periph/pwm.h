 * @brief Initialize a PWM device

 * are always identical for the complete device, hence for every channel on a device.
 *
 * The desired frequency and resolution may not be possible on a given device when chosen
 * too large. In this case the PWM driver will always keep the resolution and decrease the
 * frequency if needed. To verify the correct settings compare the returned value which
 * is the actually set frequency.
