 *
 * The HWRNG interface abstracts means provided by MCU peripherals to create
 * random number. On most platforms, these peripherals are called something like
 * 'hardware random number generator' or 'pseudo random number generator'. The
 * quality of the created random data does differ quite a bit between different
 * MCUs, so please refer to your MCUs reference manual for information on this!
 *
 * @note    Refer to your platforms MCU reference manual for information on the
 *          quality of the used (pseudo) random number generator!
