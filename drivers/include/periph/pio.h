 * @brief       Low-level PIO peripheral driver
 *
 * Programmable IO (PIO) is a cycle accurate IO control interface to emulate
 * common IO standards like: I2C, SPI, UART or custom wire protocols as for the
 * well known WS2812B LEDs.
 * PIO programs are written in an MCU specific assembly language and they are
 * saved in .pio files. The programs have to be loaded in the PIOs instruction
 * memory. Once written to memory, a program can be executed by a state machines.
 * A state machine can only execute one program at a time but multiple state
 * machines can run the same program as access to instruction memory is shared.
 * The user is responsible to allocate/deallocate instruction memory and
 * lock/unlock state machines.
 *
 * PIO programs are very versatile and execution may depend on hardware quirks,
 * thus specific setup must be performed by the CPU PIO driver implementation
 * and the program code itself.
 * The CPU driver implementation provides a set of known programs for common
 * IO standards but user written programs are also possible and should be placed
 * in cpu/$(CPU_FAM)/pio to make use of the processor specific PIO interface.
 *
 * This API simply takes a look at PIO programs as something that resides in
 * memory and can be executed on demand, by a state machine.
 *
 * @experimental    This API is experimental and in an early state -
 *                  expect changes!
