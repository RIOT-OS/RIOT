 * @brief       Low-level ADC peripheral driver interface
 *
 * This is a very simple ADC interface to allow platform independent access to
 * a MCU's ADC unit(s). This interface is intentionally designed as simple as
 * possible, to allow for very easy implementation and maximal portability.
 *
 * As of now, the interface does not allow for any advanced ADC concepts (e.g.
 * continuous mode, scan sequences, injections). It is to be determined, if
 * these features will ever be integrated in this interface, or if it does make
 * more sense to create a second, advanced ADC interface for this.
 *
 * The ADC driver interface is built around the concept of ADC lines. An ADC
 * line in this context is a tuple consisting out of a hardware ADC device (an
 * ADC functional unit on the MCU) and an ADC channel connected to pin.
 *
 * If a MCU has more than one hardware ADC unit, the ADC lines can be mapped in
 * a way, that it is possible to sample multiple lines in parallel, given that
 * the ADC implementation allows for interruption of the program flow while
 * waiting for the result of a conversion (e.g. through putting the calling
 * thread to sleep while waiting for the conversion results).
 *
 * @todo        Extend interface for continuous mode?
