 * @brief       Peripheral GPIO Low-Level API
 *
 * @warning     This API is not stable yet and intended for internal use only
 *              as of now.
 *
 * # Design Goals
 *
 * This API aims to provide low-level access to GPIOs with as little
 * abstraction and overhead in place as possible for the hot code paths, while
 * providing a relatively high-level and feature complete API for the
 * configuration of GPIO pins. The former is to enable sophisticated use cases
 * such at bit-banging parallel protocols, bit-banging at high data rates,
 * bit-banging with strict timing requirements, or any combination of these.
 * The latter is to expose as much of the features the (arguably) most
 * important peripheral of the MCU as possible.
 *
 * It is possible to implement the high level pin-based GPIO API of RIOT, @ref
 * drivers_periph_gpio, on top of this API. It is expected that for many use
 * cases the high level API will still remain the API of choice, since it is
 * more concise an easier to use.
 *
 * Note that this API is likely to be faster moving than the high level GPIO
 * API, as it intents to match the hardware features more closely. Hence, new
 * support for new MCUs are more likely to result in API changes here. This is
 * another reason why only users interested in the low level access to GPIOs
 * should be using the this low level API, while the high level API will cater
 * all the LED blinking and button sensing use cases with a more convenient
 * and more very stable interface.
 *
 * # Thread Safety
 *
 * All functions provided by this API have to be implemented in a thread-safe
 * manner, except for @ref gpio_ll_prepare_write and
 * @ref gpio_ll_prepare_write_all_outputs. If the read-modify-write operations
 * @ref gpio_ll_set, @ref gpio_ll_clear, and @ref gpio_ll_toggle can be done
 * atomically in hardware with predictable timing, this must be used in the
 * implementation. Otherwise IRQs have to be disabled during read-modify-write
 * sequences. Calls to @ref gpio_ll_write are inherently thread-safe and
 * lock-less, but sharing pins on the same port between threads is still
 * requires a lock between the calls to @ref gpio_ll_prepare_write and
 * @ref gpio_ll_write in the general case.
 *
 * Under no circumstances two threads may call @ref gpio_ll_init on the same
 * port / pin combination concurrently.
