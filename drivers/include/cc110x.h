 * @ingroup     drivers_netdev
 *
 * This module contains the driver for the TI CC1100/CC110e/CC1101 Sub-GHz
 * transceivers.
 *
 * @warning How the CC1100/CC1101 operate can be configured quite sophistically.
 *          This has the drawback, that configurations breaking laws and rules
 *          are complete possible. Please make sure that the configured output
 *          power, duty cycle, frequency range, etc. conform to the rules,
 *          standards and laws that apply in your use case.
 *
 *
 * Supported Hardware and how to obtain
 * ====================================
 *
 * This driver has been developed for the CC1101 and the older CC1100
 * transceiver and tested for both. However, it should work with the CC1100e
 * as well - but this has *NOT* been tested at all.
 *
 * It is suggested to go for the CC1101 when considering to buy one of the
 * supported transceivers. The easiest way is to obtain CC1101 break out boards
 * with a complete antenna circuit & antenna that can be connected via jumper
 * wires using an 8 pin DIP pin header. These are sold in various flavours start
 * from less than 2€ at quantity one at your favourite Far East store. Beware
 * that while the CC1101 chip can operate a various base frequencies, the
 * antenna circuit will only work for a single frequency band. Most break out
 * boards will operate at 433 MHz, which is license free in many countries (but
 * verify that for your country before buying!). EU citizens might prefer the
 * 868 MHz band over the 433 MHz, as more license free bandwidth is available
 * in the 868 MHz band in the EU. (But when deploying only a few dozens of
 * devices, the 433 MHz band is also fine for EU citizens.) US citizens should
 * go for the 900 MHz band (as 868 MHz is not license free in the USA), which
 * even contains more bandwidth than the 868 MHz band. (However, the 900 MHz
 * band has not been tested, as using it would be illegal in the EU.)

 *
 * The Length Field contains the length of the driver supplied data in bytes,
 * not counting the Length Field. Thus, it contains the length of the payload
 * plus the length of the Destination and Source address.
 *
 *
 * Layer-2 Addresses
 * -----------------
 *
 * The layer 2 addresses of the CC110x transceivers is a single byte long and
 * the special value `0x00` for the destination address is used in broadcast
 * transmissions. The transceiver is configured by this driver to ignore all
 * packets unless the destination address matches the address of the transceiver
 * or the destination address is `0x00`.
 *
 * Please note that the layer 2 address by default is derived from the CPU ID.
 * Due to the birthday paradox with only 20 devices the probability of a
 * collision is already bigger than 50%. Thus, manual address assignment is
 * supported by defining `C110X_PARAM_L2ADDR`.
 *
 *
 * Base Band, Data Rate, Channel Bandwidth and Channel Map Configuration
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * This driver allows to configure the base band, the data rate and the channel
 * bandwidth using an @ref cc110x_config_t data structure. Default
 * configurations are supplied and name using the following scheme:
 * `cc110x_config_<BASE-BAND>_<DATA-RATE>_<CHANNEL-BANDWIDTH>`. (E.g.
 * @ref cc110x_config_868mhz_250kbps_300khz is the default configuration used by
 * the MSB-A2 and the MSB-IoT boards.)
 *
 * Using the @ref cc110x_chanmap_t data structure the channel layout can be
 * defined. This map contains 8 entries, each defines the offset from the base
 * frequency defined in the @ref cc110x_config_t data structure for each
 * channel in steps of 50kHz. E.g. @ref cc110x_chanmap_868mhz_lora provides
 * the LoRa channels 10 to 17 in the 868MHz band. (The RIOT channel numbers
 * will always start from 0, and currently only up to eight channels are
 * supported. A special value of 255 as offset from the base frequency in the
 * channel map is used mark the channel as disabled. This can be used if less
 * than 8 non-overlapping channels are possible in the license free band.)
 *
 * Please note that the channel map (@ref cc110x_chanmap_t) must match the
 * base configuration (@ref cc110x_config_t), as the channel map is relative
 * to the configured base frequency. Also, the distance between the channels
 * in the channel map should match the channel bandwidth of the configuration,
 * as otherwise channels could overlap.
 *
 * Both configuration and matching channel map can be applied using
 * @ref cc110x_apply_config. Please consider this as a slow operation, as the
 * transceiver needs to be calibrated for each channel in the channel map.
 *
 *
 * Calibration of the Frequency Generator
 * ======================================
 *
 * The CC110x transceivers use a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a
 * phase locked loop (PLL) for frequency generation. However, they need to be
 * calibrated to work correctly with the given supply voltage and the current
 * temperature. The driver will perform this calibration during startup, but
 * when the supply voltage or the temperature is not stable, a recalibration is
 * required whenever the supply voltage of temperature has changed too much since
 * the last calibration. This can be done by calling
 * @ref cc110x_full_calibration. It is left to the application developer to
 * perform this calibration when needed. During a test of about 2 hours of
 * operation in an in-door environment with a stable temperature the CC1101 has
 * worked reliable without any calibration at all (except for the automatic
 * calibration at start up). So there are use cases which do not require any
 * recalibration at all.
 *
 *
 * Troubleshooting
 * ===============
 *
 * The Driver Does Not Initialize Properly
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Set `ENABLE_DEBUG` in `cc110x_netdev.c` to `1` to get debug output, which
 * will likely tell you what is going wrong. There are basically two things
 * that can fail:
 *
 * Upon initialization the driver will read out the part number and version of
 * the transceiver. If those do not match the ones expected for the CC1100,
 * CC1100E, or the CC1101 the driver will refuse to initialize. If this fails,
 * most likely incorrect values are read out and the SPI communication does not
 * work correctly. However, future revisions of the CC110X transceivers might
 * be produced and might have different values for the part number or version.
 * If this should happen and they remain compatible with the driver, their
 * part number & revision needs to be added to the driver.
 *
 * After uploading the configuration, the driver will read back the
 * configuration to verify it. If the SPI communication is not reliable (e.g.
 * sporadically bits flip), this will fail from time to time. E.g. on the
 * MSB-IoT boards this is the case when the SPI interface operates at a clock of
 * 5MHz, but it becomes reliable when clocked at 1MHz.
 *
 * The Driver Initializes, but Communication Is Impossible
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * If two transceivers are too close to each other and TX power is at maximum,
 * the signal is just too strong to be received correctly. Reducing TX power
 * or increasing the distance (about half a meter should be fine) will solve
 * this issue.
 *
 * While the chips can operate at any base frequency offered by the driver,
 * the circuit the chip is connected to and the antenna are build for a single
 * base band. Check if your configuration matches the frequency range the
 * board is build for. E.g. most break out boards operate at 433MHz, but there
 * are also boards for 868MHz.

 * @brief   Structure to hold mapping between virtual and physical channel numbers

 * This driver will provide "virtual" channel numbers 0 to 7, which will be

 *
 * - The transceiver does not support channel maps with varying distance between
 *   channels. However, e.g. the LoRa channels 10 - 16 in the 868 MHz band have
 *   a distance of 300 kHz, but channel 16 and 17 have a distance of 1 MHz.

 *
 * This mapping overcomes both limitations be using 50kHz physical channel
 * spacing and use the map to translate to the correct physical channel. This
 * also allows to keep the same MDMCFG1 and MDMCFG0 configuration register
 * values for all channel layouts. Finally, different channel sets can be
 * used by different groups of IoT device in the same environment to limit
