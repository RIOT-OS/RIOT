 * # Wiring the LTC4150
 * Hint: M Grusin thankfully created an
 * [open hardware breakout board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/LTC4150_BOB_v10.pdf).
 * As a result, virtually all LTC4150 breakout boards are using this schematic.
 * Whenever this documentation refers to a breakout board, this open hardware
 * board is meant. Of course, this driver works with the "bare" LTC4150 as well.
 *
 * Please note that this driver works interrupt driven and does not clear the
 * signal. Thus, the /CLR and /INT pins on the LTC4150 need to be connected
 * (in case of the breakout board: close solder jumper SJ1), so that the signal
 * is automatically cleared.
 *
 * Hint: The breakout board uses external pull up resistors on /INT, POL and
 * /SHDN. Therefore /SHDN can be left unconnected and no internal pull ups are
 * required for /INT and POL. In case your board uses 3.3V logic the solder
 * jumpers SJ2 and SJ3 have to be closed, in case of 5V they have to remain
 * open. Connect the VIO pin to the logic level, GND to ground, IN+ and IN- to
 * the power supply and use OUT+ and OUT- to power your board.
 *
 * In the easiest case only the /INT pin needs to be connected to a GPIO,
 * and (in case of external pull ups) /SHDN and POL can be left unconnected.
 * The GPIO /INT is connected to support for interrupts, /SHDN and POL
 * (if connected) do not require interrupt support.
 *
 * In case a battery is used, the module `ltc4150_bidirectional` should also be
 * added and the POL pin connected to another GPIO. This allows to distinguish
 * between charge drawn from the battery and charge transferred into the battery
 * (used to load it).
 *
 * In case support to power off the LTC4150 is desired, the /SHDN pin needs to
 * be connected to a third GPIO.
 *
 * # Things to keep in mind
 * The LTC4150 creates pulses with a frequency depending on the current drawn.
 * Thus, more interrupts need to be handled when more current is drawn, which
 * in turn increases system load (and power consumption). The interrupt service
 * routing is quite short and even when used outside of specification less than
 * 20 ticks per second will occur. Hence, this effect should hopefully be
 * negligible.
