 * @defgroup    drivers_pca9685 PCA9685 I2C PWM controller
 * @ingroup     drivers_actuators
 * @ingroup     drivers_saul
 * @brief       Device driver for the NXP PCA9685
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * The driver supports the NXP PCA9685 16-channel, 12-bit PWM LED controller
 * connected to I2C. Although the controller is optimized for LED control,
 * the 12-bit resolution also allows the control of servos with a resolution
 * of 4 us at 60 Hz refresh signal.
 *
 * The following features of the PCA9685 are supported by the driver:
 *
 * - 16 channels with 12-bit resolution
 * - Refresh rates from 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with internal 25 MHz oscillator
 * - Totem pole outputs with 25 mA as sink and 10 mA as source at 5V
 * - Software programmable open-drain output selection
 * - Inverted outputs
 * - Active LOW Output Enable (OE) input pin
 * - External clock input with max. 50 MHz
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * The driver interface is kept as compatible as possible with the peripheral
 * PWM interface. The only differences are that
 *
 * - functions have the prefix `pca9685_` and
 * - functions require an additional parameter, the pointer to the PWM
 *   device of type #pca9685_t.
 *
 * Please refer the test application in `tests/driver_pca9685` for an example
 * on how to use the driver.
 *
 * ## SAUL Capabilities
 *
 * The driver provides SAUL capabilities that are compatible to the SAUL
 * actuators of type #SAUL_ACT_SERVO.
 *
 * Each PCA9685 channel can be mapped directly to SAUL by defining an
 * according entry in \c PCA9685_SAUL_PWM_PARAMS. Please refer file
 * `$RIOTBASE/drivers/pca9685/include/pca9685_params.h` for an example.
 *
 *      pca9685_saul_pwm_params_t pca9685_saul_pwm_params[] = {
 *          {
 *              .name = "PCA9685-0:0",
 *              .dev = 0,
 *              .channel = 0,
 *              .initial = (PCA9685_PARAM_RES >> 1),
 *           },
 *          {
 *              .name = "PCA9685-0:1",
 *              .dev = 0,
 *              .channel = 1,
 *              .initial = (PCA9685_PARAM_RES >> 2),
 *           },
 *          {
 *              .name = "PCA9685-0:2",
 *              .dev = 0,
 *              .channel = 2,
 *              .initial = (PCA9685_PARAM_RES >> 3),
 *           },
 *      };
 *
 * For each PWM channel that should be used with SAUL, an entry with a name,
 * the device, the channel, and the initial value has to be defined as shown
 * above.

 * @name    PCA9685 I2C slave addresses
 *
 * PCA9685 offers 64 possible hardware-programmable I2C slave addresses.
 * Therefore the I2C slave address is defined as an offset in the range
 * from 0 to 63 to a base address #PCA9685_I2C_BASE_ADDR. PCA9685 I2C
 * slave addresses are then in the range from #PCA9685_I2C_BASE_ADDR + 0 to
 * #PCA9685_I2C_BASE_ADDR + 63
 *
 * Four I2C slave addresses have special meaning when they are enabled, the
 * All Call address (enabled by default) and three Sub Call addresses
 * disabled by default). These addresses can be used to address either all or
 * sub groups of PCF9695 controllers at the same time.
