 * @brief       AT (Hayes) command set library
 *
 * This module provides functions to interact with devices using AT commands.
 *
 * Most functions compare the bytes echoed by the device with what they
 * intended to send, and bail out if there's no match.
 *
 * Furthermore, the library tries to cope with difficulties regarding different
 * line endings. It usually sends `<command><CR>`, but expects
 * `<command>\LF\CR` as echo.
 *
 * As a debugging aid, when compiled with `-DAT_PRINT_INCOMING=1`, every input
 * byte gets printed.
 *
 * ## Command echoing ##
 * Most DCEs (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment, aka modem) support command
 * echoing and enable it by default, and so does this driver.
 * If you disabled echoing on the DCE, you can compile this driver NOT to expect
 * echoing by defining CONFIG_AT_SEND_SKIP_ECHO.
 * Note, if the driver is NOT expecting command echoing but the DCE is echoing,
 * it should work just fine if and only if the EOL sequences of both DCE and
 * DTE (Data Terminal Equipmend - i.e. the device using this driver) match, i.e.
 * `AT_RECV_EOL_1 AT_RECV_EOL_2 == AT_SEND_EOL`.
 * In other words, if you are unsure about the echoing behavior of the DCE or
 * want to support both, set AT_SEND_EOL = AT_RECV_EOL_1 AT_RECV_EOL_2 and
 * define CONFIG_AT_SEND_SKIP_ECHO. This works because the URC (Unsolicited
 * Result Code) logic will intercept the echoes (see below).
 *
 * ## Unsolicited Result Codes (URC) ##
 * An unsolicited result code is a string message that is not triggered as a
 * information text response to a previous AT command and can be output at any
 * time to inform a specific event or status change.
 *
 * Some DCEs (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment, aka modem), like the LTE
 * modules from uBlox define a grace period where URCs are guaranteed NOT to be
 * sent as the time span between:
 *  - the command EOL character reception AND command being internally accepted
 *  - the EOL character of the last response line
 *
 * As follows, there is an indeterminate amount of time between:
 *  - the command EOL character being sent
 *  - the command EOL character reception AND command being internally accepted,
 *    i.e. the begin of the grace period
 *
 * In other words, we can get a URC (or more?) just after issuing the command
 * and before the first line of response. The net effect is that such URCs will
 * appear to be the first line of response to the last issued command.
 *
 * Regardless of whether URC handling is enabled or not, URC interception
 * mechanics depend on command echoing:
 *  1. echo enabled: by observation, it seems that the grace period begins
 *   BEFORE the echoed command. This has the advantage that we ALWAYS know what
 *   the first line of response must look like and so if it doesn't, then it's a
 *   URC. Thus, any procedure that calls at_send_cmd() internally will catch any
 *   URC.
 *  2. echo disabled: commands that expect a particular type of response (e.g.
 *   @ref at_send_cmd_get_resp_wait_ok() with a non-trivial prefix,
 *   @ref at_send_cmd_wait_ok() etc.) will catch any URC. For the rest, it is
 *   the application's responsibility to decide whether the received answer is
 *   an URC or not and if yes, then @ref at_postprocess_urc() can be called with
 *   the response as parameter.
 *
 * URC handling can be enabled by adding the `at_urc` module to the
 * application. This allows to @ref at_add_urc "register" and @ref at_remove_urc
 * "de-register" URC strings to check. Later, URCs can be processed in three
 * different ways:
 *  - automatically, whenever any at_* method that intercepts URCs is called.
 *    Such methods are marked in their docstring
 *  - manually, by calling at_process_urc() periodically
 *  - manually, by calling at_postprocess_urc() with an URC as parameter. The
 *    URC is assumed to have been obtained from the device through methods that
 *    do not automatically handle URCs (for example through @ref at_recv_bytes())
 * If a registered URC has been detected the correspondent @ref at_urc_t::cb
 * "callback function" is called.
 *
 * ## Error reporting ##
 * Most DCEs (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment, aka modem) can return extra
 * error information instead of the rather opaque "ERROR" message. They have the
 * form:
 *  - `+CMS ERROR: err_code>` for SMS-related commands
 *  - `+CME ERROR: <err_code>` for other commands
 *
 * For `+CME`, this behavior is usually off by default and can be toggled with:
 *  `AT+CMEE=<type>`
 * where `<type>` may be:
 *  - 0 disable extended error reporting, return `ERROR`
 *  - 1 enable extended error reporting, with `<err_code>` integer
 *  - 2 enable extended error reporting, with `<err_code>` as string
 * Check your DCE's manual for more information.
 *
 * Some of the API calls below support detailed error reporting. Whenever they
 * detect extended error responses, -AT_ERR_EXTENDED is returned and `<err_code>`
 * can be retrieved by calling @ref at_get_err_info().
