 * @defgroup    sys_dbgpin Direct pin control for debugging/profiling
 * @ingroup     sys
 *
 * This module gives the possibility to directly control a number of GPIO pins
 * without the least possible overhead for debugging and profiling purposes. For
 * this, the module provides a number of macros for setting, clearing, and
 * toggling some defined pins: `DBGPIN[\d]_[SET|CLR|TGL]`, for example
 * `DBGPIN0_SET` or `DBGPIN1_TGL`.
 *
 * To use this module, you have to do two things:
 * 1. the module has to be selected in your project: `USEMODULE += dbgpin`
 * 2. you have to define the pins you want to use for debugging, e.g.:
 *    `CFLAGS += -DDBGPIN0=GPIO_PIN\(0,15\) -DDBGPIN1=GPIO_PIN\(1,24\)`
 *
 * It is of course up to you to add these settings to your application Makefile
 * for the duration of debugging/profiling or to set them through environment
 * variables in your host systems shell.
 *
 * The initialization function is automatically called as early as possible
 * during the system initialization so the debug pins can be used already during
 * e.g. auto_init and so on.
