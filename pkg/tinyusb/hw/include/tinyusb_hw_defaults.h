 * @brief       Hardware specific default configurations for tinyUSB
 *
 * The platform or the board can define a file `tinyusb_hw_defaults.h`
 * to define default values for tinyUSB such as `TINYUSB_TUD_RHORT`
 * or `TINYUSB_TUH_RHPORT` according to the given hardware. In case
 * the platform or board does not define such a file, this dummy file
 * is used instead.
