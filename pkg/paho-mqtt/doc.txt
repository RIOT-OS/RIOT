 @brief    The Eclipse Paho project provides open-source client implementations of MQTT for embedded systems
 @see      https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.embedded-c
 
 The Eclipse Paho project provides open-source client
 implementations of MQTT.

  # Supported MQTT protocol versions

  The supported protocol versions of the used paho.mqtt.embedded-c stack are
    - MQTT-Version = 3.1 (MQTTVersion struct member of MQTTPacket_connectData = 3)
    - MQTT-Version = 3.1.1 (MQTTVersion struct member of MQTTPacket_connectData = 4)

  # Implementation specific information

  - The main loop runs in a dedicated thread (`paho_mqtt_riot`) in the function `mqtt_riot_run()` with a default cycle of 30ms (MQTT_YIELD_POLLING_MS)
    and a default duration of 10ms (PAHO_MQTT_YIELD_MS)
  - When publishing a topic with `MQTTPublish()` and QoS>0, the function blocks until an acknowledgement (QoS=1) or two confirmations (QoS=2) were received
