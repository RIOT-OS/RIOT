 * @brief   TomsFastMath is a fast public domain, open source, large integer arithmetic library written in portable ISO C
 * @see     https://github.com/libtom/tomsfastmath
 *
 * There are 2 defines which you will probably need to configure:
 *
 * FP_MAX_SIZE Integers in tomsfastmath have a fixed precision which is to be set at compile time. Set the desired bitlength with this define. The default value is 4096 + a little overhead.
 *
 * THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN If you use a lot of large integers, you will probably need to increase the maximum stack size of the main thread (or the thread where you do your calculations).
