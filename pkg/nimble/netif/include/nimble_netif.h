 * @defgroup    pkg_nimble_netif GNRC netif Implementation
 * @ingroup     pkg_nimble
 * @brief       GNRC netif implementation for NimBLE, enabling the integration
 *              of NimBLE into GNRC
 *
 * # About
 * This NimBLE submodule provides a GNRC netif wrapper for integrating NimBLE
 * with GNRC and other network stacks using netif (e.g. CCNlite).
 *
 * # Concept
 * According to the IPv6-over-BLE standards (RFC7668 and IPSP), this module
 * exposes a (configurable) number of point-to-point BLE connections as a single
 * network device to BLE. Unicast traffic is only send using the corresponding
 * BLE connection. Multicast and Broadcast packets are duplicated and send via
 * each open BLE connection.
 *
 * # Structure
 * The netif implementation is able to handle multiple connections
 * simultaneously. The maximum number of concurrent connections is configured
 * during compile time, using NimBLEs MYNEWT_VAL_BLE_MAX_CONNECTIONS option.
 * Dependent on this value, the netif implementation takes care of allocation
 * all the memory needed. The API of this submodule uses simply integer values
 * to reference the used connection context (like file descriptors in linux).
 *
 * Like any other GNRC network device, the NimBLE netif wrapper runs in its own
 * thread. This thread is started and configured by the common netif code. All
 * send and get/set operations are handled by this thread. For efficiency
 * reasons, receiving of data is however handled completely in the NimBLE host
 * thread, from where the received data is directly passed on to the
 * corresponding GNRC thread.
 *
 * Although the wrapper hooks into GNRC using the netif interface, it does need
 * to implement parts of the netdev interface as well. This is done where
 * needed.
 *
 * # Usage
 * This submodule is designed to work fully asynchronous, in the same way as the
 * NimBLE interfaces are designed. All functions in this submodule will only
 * trigger the intended action. Once this action is complete, the module will
 * report the result asynchronously using the configured callback.
 *
 * So before using this module, make sure to register a callback using the
 * @ref nimble_netif_eventcb() function.
 *
 * After this, this module provides functions for managing BLE connections to
 * other devices. Once these connections are established, this module takes care
 * of mapping IP packets to the corresponding connections.

/**
 * @brief   Set to > 0 to enforce different connection intervals for each of the
 *          nodes BLE connections
 *
 * Enabling this option will enforce that every BLE connection a node maintains,
 * independent of the nodes role, uses a different connection interval. The
 * value of NIMBLE_NETIF_CONN_ITVL_SPACING specifies the minimum spacing between
 * connection intervals as multiple of 1,25ms. E.g. a value of 2 will force each
 * connection to use a connection interval that is at least 2.5ms different from
 * all other used connection intervals.
 *
 * If a node is the coordinator of a connection, it will generate a connection
 * interval for each new connection based on a random value by adhering to the
 * spacing constraint.
 *
 * If a node is the subordinate of a new connection, it will check if the given
 * connection interval is fulfilling the spacing constraint with respect to
 * already existing connections of that node. If the connection interval of the
 * new connection is not properly spaced, the node will drop the connection
 * right away, giving the coordinator node the possibly to reconnect with a
 * different connection interval.
