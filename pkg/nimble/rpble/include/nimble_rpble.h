 * @brief       RPL-over-BLE for Nimble implementation
 *
 * # About
 * This module implements a BLE connection manager the manages BLE connections
 * for (multi-hop) IP over BLE networks based on meta data provided by RPL.
 *
 *
 * # Concept
 * In their initial state, after power up or reboot, nodes start to scan for
 * BLE advertisements containing a specific advertising data (AD) field which
 * holds information about RPL DODAGs. For a configured amount of time, the node
 * ranks all senders of the received advertising packets based on a given
 * metric. After this time, the node selects the best fitting parent based on
 * this ranking and tries to connect to that peer.
 *
 * After a node has successfully opened a connection to its parent node, the
 * node starts to advertise its own RPL context data to accept connections
 * from potential child nodes.
 *
 * This approach leads to a BLE network topology that is equal to the IP routing
 * topology created by RPL on top.
 *
 * ## Advertising data structure
 * To include RPL context information into (legacy) BLE advertisements, it must
 * be encoded into the BLE advertising data format. This implementation uses
 * a custom sub-format that is included into the 16-bit UUID Service Data
 * (type: 0x16) field (Supplement to Bluetooth Core Specification CSSv8, 1.11).
 * The 16-bit UUID in this field is set to the IPSS service ID (0x1820).
 *
 * The following sub-format is used to encode the RPL context data:
 * ```
 * byte     1: instance ID (1b)
 * byte  2-17: DODAG ID (16b)
 * byte    18: DODAG version (1b)
 * byte    19: RPL role (1b)
 * byte 20-21: rank (2b)
 * byte    22: number of free BLE connection slots (1b)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Ranking of potential parents
 * The currently implemented ranking metric is very simple: the potential parent
 * node with the smallest rank is chosen. Additionally, nodes advertise the
 * number of free BLE connection slots. In case where multiple nodes advertise
 * the same RPL rank, the one with the largest number of open BLE connection
 * slots is selected. The idea behind this is to balance the number of BLE
 * connections per node, and with that also to balance the RPL DODAG.
 *
 *
 * # Usage
 * To use this module, simply include `nimble_rpble` into your build. If nothing
 * is explicitly configured, the module will use the default configuration as
 * specified in `pkg/nimble/rpble/include/nimble_rpble_params.h`.
 *
 * Once a node is configured as RPL root (e.g. using the `rpl root ..` shell
 * command), it will automatically start to advertise itself. Non-RPL-root nodes
 * will automatically scan for potential parent nodes and join the network as
 * soon as they find fitting neighbors.
 *
 *
 * ## Implementation status
 * In its current state, the implementation only works for environments where a
 * single RPL network with a single DODAG are present. The DODAG ID, instance
 * ID, and DODAG version are currently pretty much ignored when scanning for
 * potential parents.
