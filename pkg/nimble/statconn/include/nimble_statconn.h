 * @brief       Static connection manager for NimBLE netif that keeps opens
 *              connections on demand and takes care of keeping them open.
 *
 * @experimental
 *
 * # WARNING
 * This module is highly experimental! Expect bugs, instabilities and sudden API
 * changes :-)
 *
 *
 * # About
 * Statconn is the implementation of a static connection manager for the NimBLE
 * netif module. It initiates new connections when told and additionally takes
 * care of reopening connections in case of connection loss.
 *
 *
 * # Usage
 * A node can either be a master, the one initiating the connection, or a
 * slave, the one advertising its presence, w.r.t. to BLE connections. To open
 * a connection between two nodes, call nimble_statconn_add_slave() with the
 * BLE address of the slave node on the designated master node and call
 * nimble_statconn_add_master() with the address of the master node on the
 * designated slave node. From that point on, statconn will take care of
 * opening and maintaining the connection between these two nodes.
 *
 *
 * # Configuration
 * This module is configured completely statically. All relevant configuration
 * options are set at compile time using a couple of macros.
