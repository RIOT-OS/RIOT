 *
 * # MicroPython RIOT package
 *
 * "MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3
 *  programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard
 *  library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained
 *  environments."
 *
 * @see https://micropython.org
 *
 * ## Status
 *
 * MicroPython on RIOT has to be considered experimental. While the basic
 * interpreter works fairly well on native and Cortex-M, it has not seen much
 * testing.
 *
 * ## Configuration options
 *
 * Use the following environment variables in the application Makefile
 * or from the command line to configure MicroPython:
 *
 * MP_RIOT_HEAPSIZE: heap size for MicroPython, in bytes. Defaults to 16KiB.
 *
 * Example on the command line:
 * ```
 * MP_RIOT_HEAPSIZE=2048 make -C examples/lang_support/community/micropython
 * ```
 *
 * ## Implementation details
 *
 * The RIOT port of MicroPython currently resides in a fork at
 * https://github.com/kaspar030/micropython (in branch add_riot_port). It is
 * based on Micropython's "ports/minimal" with some extra modules enabled.
 * It reuses the gc_collect code from ports/unix, which has special support
 * for i386 and Cortex-M. On other platforms, it uses setjmp() to collect
 * registers.
 *
 * ## MicroPython's test suite
 *
 * It is possible to run MicroPython's test suite for testing this port.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. make -C examples/lang_support/community/micropython flash
 * 2. cd examples/lang_support/community/micropython/bin/pkg/${BOARD}/micropython
 * 3. git apply ports/riot/slow_uart_writes.patch
 * 4. cd tests
 * 5. ./run-tests --target pyboard --device ${PORT}
 *
 * ## MicroPython modules
 *
 * Currently, the port enables only a subset of the available MycroPython
 * modules. See "ports/riot/mpconfigport.h" for details.
 *
 * For now, the utime module has RIOT specific code and should work as expected.
 *
 * ## RIOT specific modules
 *
 * Currently, these are implemented:
 *
 * ### thread_getpid()
 *
 *     >>> import riot
 *     >>> print(riot.thread_getpid())

 * ### xtimer
 *
 *     >>> import xtimer
 *     >>>
 *     >>> a = 0
 *     >>> def inc_a():
 *     >>>   global a
 *     >>>   a += 1
 *     >>>
 *     >>> t = xtimer.xtimer(inc_a)
 *     >>> t.set(100000)
 *     >>> print(a)
 *
 * ## How to use
 *
 * See examples/lang_support/community/micropython for example code.
