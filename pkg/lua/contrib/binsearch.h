 * @brief   Generic binary search for tables containing strings.
 * @author  Juan Carrano <j.carrano@fu-berlin.de>
 *
 * It is often the case that one has an array of structs, where one of the
 * members of the struct is a string pointer containing a key that must be
 * searched. If the array is sorted by this key and of known length, a binary
 * search can be performed.
 *
 * To make the code generic we must reinterpret the structure array
 * as an array of pointers to string with a stride (separation in bytes between
 * elements) and offset (position of the first element relative to the start of
 * the array) given by the struct definition.
 *
 * For example, given the following struct and array definitions and assuming
 * a 32 bit platform with strict alignment:
 *  struct s1 {
 *      int a;      // Takes up 4 bytes
 *      char *name; // Takes up 4 bytes
 *      char m;     // Takes up 1 byte
 *  };
 *  struct s1 my_table[] = {......};
 *
 * Then each element of my_table will be aligned to 12 bytes. The address of the
 * "name" field of the first elements will be 4 bytes more than the address of
 * "my_table". With this two numbers we can compute the address of the i-th
 * "name" field as:
 *      [address of my_table] + offset + i*stride
 * Where stride=12 bytes and offset = 4 bytes.
