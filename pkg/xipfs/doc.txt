 * @brief    The eXecute In-Place File System
 *
 *`xipfs` is a file system designed to streamline post-issuance software
 * deployment.
 *
 * `xipfs` allows direct execution of programs from flash memory, eliminating
 * the need for prior copying to RAM.
 *
 * This approach conserves memory space and accelerates boot times, as the
 * microcontroller can run code directly from storage memory without preloading into RAM.
 *
 * The `xipfs` structure is based on a linked list, where each file occupies at least one flash memory page.
 *
 * To prevent fragmentation, when a file is deleted, subsequent files are shifted to fill the vacant space.
 *
 *`xipfs` is compatible with all microcontrollers featuring addressable
 * flash memory and most operating systems, provided they implement the
 * necessary functions to interact with the flash controller.
 *
 * **To have a viable executable file within XiPFS**, please follow these steps :
 * - create a file with executable flag.
 * - Fill it with actual compiled code in an appropriate file format, here XiPFS-Format.
 * *This is where the actual startup sequence and relocation happen*.
 * - Call execute on it with appropriate args *at least the executable filename should be passed along*.
