 * @defgroup pkg_flashdb    FlashDB: Database for Flash
 * @ingroup  pkg
 * @brief    An ultra-lightweight embedded database
 * @see      http://armink.gitee.io/flashdb/
 *
 * This package provides a Key-Value database and a Time series database
 * that can be used with a MTD or a file system backend.
 *
 * It is recommended to use the use the MTD backend for performance reasons,
 * but if you have a filesystem anyway or want to store the database as a file
 * there is also a VFS backend that can be used instead.
 *
 * MTD Backend
 * ===========
 * To enable the MTD backend, select the `flashdb_mtd` module.
 *
 * FlashDB can only use a single MTD device. To assign a MTD device for FlashDB
 * to use, call
 *
 * ```C
 * fdb_mtd_init(MTD_0);
 * ```
 *
 * FlashDB allows for multiple partitions on the device. They have to configured
 * at compile time:
 *
 * ```
 * CFLAGS += -DFAL_PART0_LABEL=\"part0\"
 * CFLAGS += -DFAL_PART0_LENGTH=8*1024
 *
 * CFLAGS += -DFAL_PART1_LABEL=\"part1\"
 * CFLAGS += -DFAL_PART1_LENGTH=4*1024
 * ```
 *
 * The partition names have to be used in `fdb_kvdb_init()` / `fdb_tsdb_init()`.
 *
 * VFS Backend
 * ===========
 * To enable the VFS Backend, select the `flashdb_vfs` module.
 *
 * Here instead of partitions, FlashDB uses directories to store the data.
 * The directory names are used instead of the partition names in `fdb_kvdb_init()` /
 * `fdb_tsdb_init()` and you have to enable file mode by calling
 *
 * ```C
 * bool file_mode = true;
 * fdb_kvdb_control(&kvdb, FDB_KVDB_CTRL_SET_FILE_MODE, &file_mode);
 * ```
 *
 * for the Key-Value database and
 *
 * ```C
 * bool file_mode = true;
 * fdb_tsdb_control(&tsdb, FDB_TSDB_CTRL_SET_FILE_MODE, &file_mode);
 * ```
 *
 * for the time-series database.
 *
 * Key-Value database
 * ==================
 * To enable the Key-Value database, select the `flashdb_kvdb` module.
 *
 * For use of the FlashDB API, refer to the [FlashDB documentation](http://armink.gitee.io/flashdb/#/sample-kvdb-basic).
 *
 * Time series database
 * ====================
 * To enable the Key-Value database, select the `flashdb_tsdb` module.
 *
 * For use of the FlashDB API, refer to the [FlashDB documentation](http://armink.gitee.io/flashdb/#/sample-tsdb-basic).
