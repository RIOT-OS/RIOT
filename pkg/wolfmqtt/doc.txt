 * @brief    Provides the WolfMQTT client and example applications
 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * The wolfMQTT library is a client implementation of the MQTT written in C for
 * embedded use. It supports SSL/TLS via the wolfSSL library. From this, it can
 * provide the security that the MQTT protocol lacks. wolfMQTT was built from
 * the ground up to be multi-platform, space conscience and extensible. It
 * supports all Packet Types, all Quality of Service (QoS) levels 0-2 and
 * supports SSL/TLS using the wolfSSL library. This implementation provides
 * support for MQTT v5.0 and is based on MQTT v3.1.1. Additionally, there is
 * also client support for MQTT-SN (Sensor Network).
