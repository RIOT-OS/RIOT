 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * "nrfx is a standalone set of drivers for peripherals present in Nordic Semiconductor's SoCs. It
 * originated as an extract from the nRF5 SDK. The intention was to provide drivers that can be
 * used in various environments without the necessity to integrate other parts of the SDK into them.
 * For the user's convenience, the drivers come with the MDK package. This package contains
 * definitions of register structures and bitfields for all supported SoCs, as well as startup and
 * initialization files for them."
