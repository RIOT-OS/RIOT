 * @brief    Provides the WolfSSL SSL/TLS solution
 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * This package provides an embedded SSL/TLS library specifically developed for
 * memory-constrained devices.
 *
 * # License
 *
 * wolfSSL’s software is available under two distinct licensing models:
 * Open Source (GPLv2) or proprietary.
 *
 * Open Source
 *
 * wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) offers multiple products including, but not limited
 * to:
 *
 * wolfSSL
 * wolfCrypt
 * wolfMQTT
 * wolfSSH
 *
 * These software products are free software and may be modified to
 * the needs of the user as long as the user adheres to version two of the GPL
 * License. The GPLv2 license can be found on the gnu.org website
 * (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
 *
 *
 * Commercial Licensing
 *
 * Businesses and enterprises who wish to incorporate wolfSSL products into
 * proprietary appliances or other commercial software products for
 * re-distribution must license commercial versions. Commercial licenses for
 * wolfSSL, yaSSL, and wolfCrypt are available. Licenses are generally issued
 * for one product and include unlimited royalty-free distribution. Custom
 * licensing terms are also available.
 *
 * Commercial licenses are also available for wolfMQTT and wolfSSH.
 * Please contact licensing@wolfssl.com with inquiries.
 *

 *
 *
 * wolfSSL is securing over 2 billion end points today and is one of the
 * industry leading SSL/TLS/Cryptographic providers for embedded systems and the
 * IoT space. wolfSSL is very excited to be working with the RIOT-OS team!
 *
 * You can easily take advantage of wolfSSL by using the following in your
 * application Makefile:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEPKG += wolfssl
 * ```
 *
 * Don't forget to use the wolfSSL settings header in your app. This header
 * should always be included FIRST preceding any other wolfSSL headers to
 * ensure the correct configuration is picked up when including other wolfSSL
 * headers:
 *
 * ```c
 * #include <wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h>
 * ```
 *
 * FEATURES:
 *
 * Because wolfSSL was designed with embedded systems in mind the library is
 * extremely modular. There are very few dependencies in wolfSSL Cryptographic
 * library and we have chosen to setup the pkg makefile to allow for easy
 * modification by developers. We chose to include the core of our library in a
 * singular list and then separate out the features that a developer may or may
 * not wish to use by default. Please reference the Makefile.wolfssl in
 * "<RIOT-root>/pkg/wolfssl" directory. wolfSSL has chosen to enable a
 * significant portion of our wolfcrypt functionality by default and provided
 * informative comments to explain how a feature might be enabled/disabled.
 *
 * Features should be controlled with the header "user_settings.h" included with
 * the package.
 * On RIOT-OS, wolfSSL and wolfCrypt libraries can be configured using
 * PSEUDOMODULES. After selecting the wolfSSL package via:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEPKG+=wolfssl
 * ```
 *
 * Single ciphers, algorithms and features can be selected by including the
 * associated pseudomodule, e.g.:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEMODULE += wolfcrypt
 * USEMODULE += wolfssl
 * USEMODULE += wolfcrypt-test
 * USEMODULE += wolfssl_dtls
 * ```
 *
 * NOTES ON TRANSPORT LAYER:
 *
 * wolfSSL package for RIOT-OS supports two types of socket communication:
 * - GNRC UDP/IP interface (based on sock_udp)
 * - generic full-POSIX socket support (based on module posix-socket)
 *
 * By default, GNRC support is compiled in for UDP/IP communication when the
 * module `wolfssl_dtls` is selected. Ensure that the module `gnrc_sock_udp`
 * is also included in the build.
 *
 * Alternatively, to enable full-POSIX TLS/DTLS, select the `wolfssl_socket` module by
 * adding the following to the application's Makefile:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEMODULE += wolfssl_socket
 * ```
 *
 * Refer to the examples in the following section for more details about the API
 * and the integration with the transport layer.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 *
 * wolfSSL has provided a few examples of using this package in the RIOT
 * examples directory. To test these do any of the following:
 *
 * wolfSSL Test/Benchmark:
 * Useful to verify that the ciphers are working properly
 * on the target, and comparing performance on different
 * platforms.
 *
 * ```makefile
 * cd <path-to>/RIOT/tests/pkg/wolfssl-test
 * make
 * ./bin/native/wolfssl-test.elf # execute native port
 * ```
 *
 * ED25519 signature verification demo
 * Very small footprint application to demonstrate
 * Ed25519 signature verification with a very small footprint
 * and memory requirements
 *
 * ```makefile
 * cd <path-to>/RIOT/tests/pkg/wolfcrypt-ed25519-verify
 * make
 * ./bin/native/wolfcrypt-ed25519-verify.elf # execute native port
 * ```
 *
 *
 * DTLS Client and Server Example
 * DTLS example over GNRC UDP/IP stack.
 * See documentation in `examples/dtls-wolfssl/README.md`
