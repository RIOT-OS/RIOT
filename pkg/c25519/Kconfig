    help
        This package contains portable public-domain implementations of
        Daniel J. Bernstein's Curve255191 Diffie-Hellman function, and
        of the Ed25519 signature system. The memory consumption is low
        enough that they could be reasonably considered for most
        microcontroller applications. In particular, Curve25519 scalar
        multiplication uses less than half a kB of peak stack usage.
