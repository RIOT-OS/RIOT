 * @see      https://github.com/hso-esk/emb6/blob/14e4a3cfff01644e078870e14e16a1fe60dcc895/doc/pdf/emb6.pdf
 *
 * @deprecated  Based on very old version of `emb6` and the package is
 *              basically unmaintained; will be removed after the 2020.07
 *              release.
 *
 * emb6 is a fork of Contiki's uIP network stack without its usage of
 * proto-threads. It uses periodic event polling instead.
