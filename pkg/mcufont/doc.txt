 * # Introduction
 *
 * MCUFont is a stand-alone font compression, decompression and rendering
 * library for use with microcontroller systems. On microcontrollers only
 * decompression and rendering is supported, the compression part is written in
 * C++ and is not supposed to be run on constrained devices.
 *
 * MCUFont supports high quality rendering of supplied fonts with kerning and
 * anti-aliasing support. It does not support font scaling.
