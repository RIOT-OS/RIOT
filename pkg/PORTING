This directory provides some porting information for libraries and programs to
use with RIOT (to build an external module). If you'd like to add a package to
RIOT you need to add a directory with the name of your package to this directory.
Your directory should contain at least two files:

 * patch.txt    - Your patch of the upstream application of the package to make it
                  build with RIOT
 * Makefile     - A Makefile describing how to get the upstream application, apply
                  the patch and how to build the package as a RIOT module.
                  A rough template for several methods of acquiring a package
                  is provided in Makefile.git, Makefile.http, and Makefile.svn
