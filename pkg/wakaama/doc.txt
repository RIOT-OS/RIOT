 * @defgroup pkg_wakaama  LwM2M - Lightweight Machine to Machine
 * @ingroup  pkg
 * @ingroup  net
 * @brief    LwM2M implementation based on the Wakaama package
 *
 * Lightweight Machine to Machine is a device management protocol designed for sensor networks,
 * designed for remote management of M2M devices and related service enablement. It defines an
 * extensible resource and data model and builds top of CoAP. LwM2M has been specified by the
 * OMA SpecWorks Device Management Working Group. The specification is freely available
 * [here](http://openmobilealliance.org/wp/index.html).
 *
 * For a list of the supported objects see @ref lwm2m_objects.
 * The client implementation is based on the Eclipse
 * [Wakaama project](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama)
 *
 *
 * ## Usage
 * A LwM2M Client organizes resources as object instances. The LwM2M engine is independent of the
 * objects that the client exposes, but it needs at least 3 mandatory ones:
 * @ref lwm2m_objects_device "Device object", @ref lwm2m_objects_security "Security object" and a
 * Server object.
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * #include "lwm2m_client.h"
 * #include "lwm2m_client_objects.h"
 * #include "objects/security.h"
 * #include "objects/device.h"
 * #include "net/credman.h"
 *
 * // hold references to object handles
 * lwm2m_object_t *obj_list[3];
 *
 * // LwM2M Client instance
 * lwm2m_client_data_t client_data;
 *
 * // short ID for internal reference of the server
 * #define CONFIG_LWM2M_SERVER_SHORT_ID 1
 *
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *
 *    // initiate the LwM2M Client
 *    lwm2m_client_init(&client_data);
 *
 *    // arguments for instantiating a security object
 *    lwm2m_obj_security_args_t args = {
 *        .server_id = CONFIG_LWM2M_SERVER_SHORT_ID,
 *        .server_uri = "coap://[fd00:dead:beef::1]:5683",
 *        .security_mode = LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_NONE,
 *        .is_bootstrap = false,
 *        .client_hold_off_time = 5,
 *        .bootstrap_account_timeout = 0
 *    };
 *
 *    // get the Security object handle
 *    obj_list[0] = lwm2m_object_security_init(&client_data);
 *
 *    // create a new Security object instance
 *    int res = lwm2m_object_security_instance_create(&args, 1);
 *    if (res < 0) {
 *        puts("Could not instantiate the security object");
 *        return;
 *    }
 *
 *    // get the Server object handle (only single instance for now)
 *    obj_list[1] = lwm2m_client_get_server_object(&client_data, CONFIG_LWM2M_SERVER_SHORT_ID);
 *
 *    // device object has a single instance. All the information for now is defined at compile-time
 *    obj_list[2] = lwm2m_object_device_init(&client_data);
 *
 *    // run the LwM2M client
 *    lwm2m_client_run(&client_data, obj_list, ARRAY_SIZE(obj_list);
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * The LwM2M Client will connect to the specified LwM2M server and register itself. After that, the
 * server will be able to perform Read, Write, Create, Delete, Execute and Observe operations on the
 * resources.
 *
 * ### DTLS support
 * With the configuration above plain CoAP is used. To secure the connection with the LwM2M Server,
 * a credential is needed in the Security object instance. To enable DTLS support add the module
 * `wakaama_client_dtls`. This uses the @ref net_sock_dtls, so you will need to select an
 * implementation of it (e.g. `USEPKG += tinydtls`). Currently Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Raw Public
 * Key (RPK) modes are supported.
 *
 * To see how to use DTLS credentials, go to the usage section of @ref lwm2m_objects_security.
 *
 * ### Using a LwM2M Bootstrap Server
 * A bootstrap server gives a LwM2M deployment more flexibility. Information on how to connect to the
 * LwM2M bootstrap server is defined at compile-time in the client (including URI and potentially
 * needed credentials). The client connects to the bootstrap server on boot, which installs on the
 * node the information needed to connect to the LwM2M servers.
 *
 * To enable bootstrap support, set the `LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP` option on Kconfig or set the CFLAG
 * `CONFIG_LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP=1`. You will also need to specify during the security object instantiation
 * that the information corresponds to a bootstrap server. DTLS is also supported for the bootstrap
 * server:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.c}
 * lwm2m_obj_security_args_t args = {
 *     .server_id = 1,
 *     .server_uri = "coaps://[fd00:dead:beef::1]:5684",
 *     .security_mode = LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_PRE_SHARED_KEY,
 *     .pub_key_or_id = psk_id,
 *     .pub_key_or_id_len = sizeof(psk_id) - 1,
 *     .secret_key = psk_key,
 *     .secret_key_len = sizeof(psk_key) - 1,
 *     .is_bootstrap = true,
 *     .client_hold_off_time = 5,
 *     .bootstrap_account_timeout = 0
 * };
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Keep into account, that some Sock DTLS implementations may need some extra configuration to handle
 * multiple connections. See the `example/wakaama` Makefile.
