RIOT-2013.08 - Release Notes
============================
RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things: from 16-bit
microcontrollers to light-weight 32-bit processors.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT leverages a robust micro-kernel architecture based on the FeuerWare kernel
originally developed in 2008 targeting Wireless Sensor Networks, and further
developed in µkleos. As such, RIOT is the direct heir of FeuerWare and µkleos.

To lower the hurdles for new developers, all coding in RIOT can be done in
standard C (or C++) with standard tools like gcc and gdb, which also
facilitates application development and adaptation of existing Linux libraries.
Last but not least: the native port allows to run RIOT as-is on Linux and
MacOS. Multiple instances of RIOT running on a single machine can also be
interconnected via a simple virtual Ethernet bridge, which facilitates
networked application development.

Known Issues
============
#21: Deal with stdin in bordermultiplex.c
    Not all supported platforms provide a stdin in the current release.
    However, the implementation of the 6LoWPAN border router won't work
    without stdin.
#45: bit field order in the fcf may be wrong
    The CC2420 FIFO expects the IEEE802.15.4 FCF field in reversed bit order.
    This might break the implementation for other, upcoming radio
    transceivers.
#83: Wrong byte order in sixlowpan
    The 6LoWPAN stack might still contain some variables using the wrong byte
    order.
#132: segfault in vtimer update shortterm
    The vtimer is known to be buggy on all platforms and causes segmentation
    faults on the native port.
