    help
        This is used during the Kconfig migration to test the module dependency
        modelling. Don't change the default value unless you know what you are
        doing.

config DEVELHELP
    bool "Development Help"
    help
        Set to enable code in RIOT that does safety checking which might not be
        needed in a production environment but helps in the development
        process.
